5	-ar,-en,-er,-ing,-ly,-valent,em-,equi-,un-	The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI, so this would be like having J. Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s.

46	-ad,-art,-en,-et,-ey,-ing,-ly,-ome,an-,com-,ind-,on-	Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars, they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area, then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK-47's in the air.
47	-ad,-ar,-es,-ey,-ing,-le,-st,exa-,ind-	They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year, which indicates they are the same people.
48	-an,-ing,-le,-ly,ab-,an-,re-	And there is nothing we can do about it really, people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land.
49	-an,-ant,-ed,-en,-hood,-ide,-ing,-ish,-ont,-ose,-pter,ab-,al-,an-,dis-,ex-,heli-,in-	Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood, and those are trained and armed, so don't expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn't bomb them, and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen?

175	-an,-ee,-ent,-er,-ese,-ial,-ing,-ive,-le,-ly,-ry,ab-,on-,par-,re-	Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan, referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui simply as "Lee."

189	-ade,-art,-er,-ia,-ing,-ly,-ness,-ster,an-,be-,co-,con-,ex-,ov-,par-	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir, so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger.
190	-ance,-ant,-ous,inter-	I can't tell you how ominous I found Bush's performance in that interview.
191	-able,-al,-er,-ing,ab-,re-,un-	I still remember him stuttering about "the General," unable to remember Musharraf's name.
192	-ad,-ed,-er,-ing,-ly,ab-,de-,ill-,in-	He obviously had no idea what he was talking about, though he demonstrated a number of ill-fated instincts.
193	-ability,-an,-arian,-cracy,-ed,-er,-ing,-ly,-ship,-th,-ule,aut-,be-,de-,di-,like-	He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy, equating dictatorship with "stability."
194	-al,-ar,-ed,-er,-ia,-ing,-ious,-ity,-th,ab-,an-,di-,radi-,re-	And, he didn't think he needed to know anything about South Asia, with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics--the latter a dire security threat to the US.

196	-ar,-ent,-ia,-ing,-ship,-th,twi-	Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002, risking war twice that year.

198	-ability,-all,-ed,-ing,-ion,re-	This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing "stability" to the region in fall of 1999.
199	-ad,-ed,-er,-wards,ab-,an-,dec-,on-	So, one answer to Bush's charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit, Bush should have declined to run himself.
200	-an,-ar,-en,-er,-id,-ly,-wards,ab-,af-,an-,di-,fore-	Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then.
201	-al,-an,-ed,-en,-es,-ial,-ing,-th,-wards,al-,an-,con-,on-	Indeed, given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US, one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does.
202	-an,-en,-er,-es,-ess,-ia,-id,-ing,-ive,-land,-st,-ture,-wards,ab-,ac-,an-,be-,con-,re-	This is what Edwards' campaign literature said about his positions: "Edwards believes that the U.S. must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts, from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
203	-al,-en,-er,-es,-ing,-ole,-wards,an-,be-	Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel, and believes that the U.S. has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians."

208	-an,-ar,-es,-ic,-ing,-ism,-ly,-ome,-or,anti-,be-,co-,con-,ter-	As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis, some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti-American terrorism.
209	-ability,-an,-ed,-er,-es,-fer,-ly,ac-,an-,in-,like-	Israel, however, is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States.
210	-ar,-ative,-est,-ly,-on,-ster,an-,neo-	Ironically, among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US.
211	-ed,-er,-ey,-ity,-ly,ac-	Have they, however, actually weakened Israeli security?
212	-al,-ation,-es,-est,-ian,-ics,bi-,con-	The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements.
213	-ed,-es,-ess,-ian,-icide,-ine,-ling,-on,an-,de-,en-,in-,sui-	The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard-line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings.
214	-ade,-al,-ed,-ess,-in,-ly,-ment,-ry,ac-,an-,co-,dis-,im-,in-,inter-,like-,re-	This, in turn, has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there.
215	-al,-ed,-en,-ese,-ite,-ory,-ty,be-,par-,radi-,ter-,with-	Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000, the radical Lebanese Shiite party, Hizbullah, has not been mollified.

217	-al,-amine,-ar,-ity,-ly,-ment,-st,-th,after-,an-,con-,en-,exa-,im-,like-	Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel's security environment must, therefore, closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare.
218	-al,-ar,-ed,-ein,-en,-ence,-er,-es,-ey,-ian,-icide,-ly,ac-,al-,an-,en-,mon-,sui-,with-	Although it is often alleged (without much evidence) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare, it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel.
219	-ation,-en,-es,-est,-ic,-ling,an-,be-,con-,eco-,en-	The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations.
220	-al,-er,-id,-ing,an-,di-	Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians.
221	-ade,-al,-ate,-es,-ive,-ly,-ome,be-,de-,over-,re-	At some points, as in the late 1980s, he reportedly made behind-the-scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal.

223	-ad,-al,-ar,-ate,-ed,-es,-gram,-logical,an-,bio-,chemi-,de-	By the late 1990s, Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program, and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles.
224	-ad,-an,-ed,-ion,-le,-ly,be-,col-,in-	Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003.
225	-ability,-al,-ard,-ed,-ee,-ent,-ist,an-,di-,in-,re-	If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel, it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability.
226	-ar,-ate,-ation,-ed,-ling,ad-,an-,post-	The bungling of post-war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state.
227	-ary,-ed,-en,-ence,-ial,-ing,-mer,-th,an-,ex-,for-,sub-	Armed militias, many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience, have proliferated.
228	-ary,-ed,-eme,-ian,-ic,-ly,-or,-ose,-th,-tion,al-,para-	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, whose 15,000-strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
229	-al,-ian,-ling,-logical,-or,an-	Anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian feeling is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents.
230	-al,-ant,-ate,-cratic,-es,-ly,-st,ag-,an-,de-,gen-,radi-	The more radical Shiites, who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel.

232	-al,-ate,-ation,-en,-er,-es,-ious,-ity,-or,-ous,an-,aut-,de-,en-,ov-	Worse for Israel, the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites.
233	-ad,-ed,-en,-es,-ese,-ite,an-,be-,re-	These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein's regime, but have now organized and armed themselves.
234	-al,-ed,-es,-ese,-ey,-ian,-th,al-,an-,histo-,re-	They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites.
235	-able,-es,-ese,-et,-ey,-ide,-ite,-ly,-st,-th,-tion,-ture,ag-,an-,cor-,en-,in-,like-,radi-	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel, and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals.
236	-al,-an,-ine,-ize,-ly,-ose,-th,an-,de-,histo-,in-,sym-	Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas, and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine.
237	-ad,-an,-ence,-er,-es,-ment,-ular,an-,in-,un-	Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad, and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement, which is popular in Jordan.
238	-ist,-ize,-ly,-ose,-th,-tion,-ular,al-,an-,ex-,post-,sym-,uni-	Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians, and those in post-Saddam Iraq are no exception.
239	-ed,-ee,-er,-ey,-ist,-ize,-ly,-ol,-ship,con-,di-,en-,un-	Whereas Saddam Hussein's dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control, they are now free to organize.
240	-ably,-ate,-ed,-ist,-ity,-or,-ry,an-,in-	An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel.
241	-an,-ed,-en,-es,-ity,-le,ab-,an-,be-,co-,re-	If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq, its citizens will be able to benefit from the country's petroleum reserves.

243	-an,-ed,-est,-ing,-ity,-ly,-or,-th,ac-,be-,inter-,on-	Israel's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors, which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians.

246	-ed,-est,-in,-ist,-ity,-ly,-tion,an-,twi-	The promotion by the pro-Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened, not strengthened, Israeli security.

351	-age,-ard,-ed,-ing,-ion,-ly,-tion,co-,ever-,ex-,on-,pre-	News coverage of the president’s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else.
352	-id,-or,-st,di-,ful-,re-	So just for the record, here, in full, is what Bush did:
353	-ard,-ed,-ent,-ture,pre-	The future president joined the Guard in May 1968.
354	-an,-ed,-ing,-ly,-most,be-,ex-,im-	Almost immediately, he began an extended period of training.
355	-ic,-ing,-ix	Six weeks of basic training.

358	-er,-in,-ing,-th,an-,be-	That was 80 weeks to begin with, and there were other training periods thrown in as well.
359	full-	It was full-time work.
360	-ad,-ed,-er,-ly,ov-	By the time it was over, Bush had served nearly two years.
363	-er,-ing	After training, Bush kept flying, racking up hundreds of hours in F-102 jets.
364	-al,-ard,-ed,-id,-ward,ac-,di-,re-,to-	As he did, he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements.
365	-ate,-ation,-ed,-en,-et,-ly,ac-,mini-,re-	At the time, guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation.
366	-ar,-ed,-er,-ing,-st,re-	According to records released earlier this year, Bush earned 253 points in his first year, May 1968 to May 1969 (since he joined in May 1968, his service thereafter was measured on a May-to-May basis).
367	-ed	Bush earned 340 points in 1969-1970.
368	-ar,-ed,-er,-fy,-ix,-one,-or,al-,en-,ent-,re-	[In other words, Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969-1970 alone.

370	-ed	He earned 137 points in 1970-1971.
371	-ed	And he earned 112 points in 1971-1972.
372	-ate,-ed,-ly,-st,ind-,on-	The numbers indicate that in his first four years, Bush not only showed up, he showed up a lot.
373	-id	Did you know that?
374	-al,-an,-cratic,-ee,-en,-ent,-er,-ing,-ory,-ry,ac-,anti-,be-,new-,re-	That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “deserted” (according to anti-Bush filmmaker Michael Moore) or went “AWOL” (according to Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee).
375	-ate,-ed,-ion,-or	Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.
376	-id,-or,off-,super-	His superior officers said OK.
377	-al,-ed,-ol,-th,an-,re-,un-	Requests like that weren’t unusual, says retired Col. William Campenni, who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971.
378	-ous,en-	“In 1972, there was an enormous glut of pilots,” Campenni says.
379	-ar,-ing,an-,de-	“The Vietnam War was winding down, and the Air Force was putting pilots in desk jobs.
380	-ad,-ard,-ation,-ed,-et,-ive,ac-,an-,wan-	In ’72 or ’73, if you were a pilot, active or Guard, and you had an obligation and wanted to get out, no problem.
381	-ing	In fact, you were helping them solve their problem.”
382	-ing,-ped	So Bush stopped flying.
383	-ed,-et,-ment,-st,en-,re-	From May 1972 to May 1973, he earned just 56 points — not much, but enough to meet his requirement.
384	-ade,-ard,-ed,-en,-in,-ing,-ly,-ness,-ol,ag-,an-	Then, in 1973, as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School, he again started showing up frequently.
385	-ar,-ed,-et,-ly,-ment,-or,ac-,an-,en-,mini-,re-	In June and July of 1973, he accumulated 56 points, enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973-1974 year.
386	-en,-est,-ion,re-	Then, at his request, he was given permission to go.
387	-able,-al,-ar,-ed,-er,-ing,-ive,-ment,af-,an-,com-,dis-,mon-,re-	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years, four months and five days of his original six-year commitment.
388	-ad,-ar,-ed,-er,-ix,ac-,co-,en-	By that time, however, he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service.
389	-ed,-ing,re-	During his service, Bush received high marks as a pilot.
390	-al,-ation,-er,-es,-id,-ly,-or,an-,con-,inter-,to-	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot” and was “a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership.”
391	-ase,-ation,-ed,-en,-ency,-er,-es,-ine,-ly,-th,an-,ex-,in-,inter-,mis-,off-,uni-	A 1971 evaluation called Bush “an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot” who “continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further.”
392	-al,-ation,-ed,-er,-or,an-,ex-,inter-,off-	And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer.”
393	-al,-er,-es,-ing,-ly,-ome,-on,an-,com-,new-,on-,out-,re-	Now, it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush’s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times, on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now.
394	-ad,-er,-ing,-or,-th,at-,ov-,re-	Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry’s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.
395	-able,-ary,-ing,-ry,-th,ent-,in-,re-	And, as it is with Kerry, it’s reasonable to look at a candidate’s entire record, including his military service — or lack of it.
396	-ant,-cide,-er,-le,-ly,ab-,deci-,im-	Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it’s important or not in November.
397	-ent,-es,-ey,-ing,-ly,-one,-or,-ry,an-,at-,ent-,re-	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans’ attack, but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons.
398	-ed,-ile,-ing,-ly,-ry	And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush’s service, while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry’s.
399	-ad,-ed,-er,-et,-id,-in,-or,-ry,-th,ab-,an-,be-,ex-	In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “has yet to explain to America whether or not, and tell the truth, about whether he showed up for duty.”
400	-able,-er,-es,-et,-id,-ry,-st,an-,be-,dis-	Earlier, Kerry said, “Just because you get an honorable discharge does not, in fact, answer that question.”
401	-ed,-er,-ode,af-,epi-,re-	Now, after the Swift boat episode, the spotlight has returned to Bush.
402	-ine	That’s fine.
403	-an	We should know as much as we can.

412	-ar,-ed,-in,-ing,-ist,-tion,-ture,an-,com-	Now that the picture is clear, the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi's Al-Iraqiya list.
413	-ad,-al,-ed,-er,-ing,-ist,-ite,-ly,an-,ex-,mini-	Ayad Allawi, and other ministers running on his list, have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning.
414	-ad,-ar,-ed,-ence,-es,-ess,-ing,-ly,-or,-ster,at-,con-,mini-,pre-,re-	One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar 'gifts' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi, a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis.
415	-an,-ed,-ing,-ist,-or,-tion,af-	Sheikh Naji Al-Abbudi, a spokesman for Sistani, affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list.
416	-ation,-ed,-en,-er,-ia,-ing,-ite,-ive,-ry,-st,ac-,ag-,al-,be-,co-,ov-	Indeed, Sistani's agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections, which has led to the assassination of at least two of them.
417	-ate,-ed,-en,-ence,-ia,-ial,-ing,-ist,-ly,ab-,an-,be-,deci-,off-,other-,out-,re-	Al-Abbudi stated that "His Emminence" decided to openly support the list because "others" (obviously a reference to Allawi) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning.
418	-al,-ation,-en,-ial,-in,-ing,-ment,al-,con-,in-,off-	Again there is no official written statement from Sistani's office confirming this allegation, which I think is intentional.

425	-ed,-ide,-in,-ion,-ish,-ist,-ly,-tion,an-,bar-,co-,out-,re-	The main Kurdish coalition list (PUK and KDP) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region.

444	-al,-ey,-id,-ing,an-,re-	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments.
445	-able,-al,-ed,-es,-ity,-ling,-ly,-mer,-st,-th,-ture,al-,an-,con-,ent-,for-,im-,re-	I concur that Ba'athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates, along with the capital, if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely.
446	-al,-ee,-ing,-on,-ont,-tion,al-,an-,be-,mis-	But I also see that as a fatal misconception, which is doing Sunnis harm, because I don't believe the US is going anywhere so soon.
447	-all,-an,-ase,-ative,-ed,-en,-ency,-er,-es,-ey,-ing,-ite,-ment,-ture,af-,al-,de-,en-,fore-,in-,re-,un-,with-	Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this, so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops, despite what he is saying now, not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture, or that they have an alternative foreign power (in this case Iran) to back them up.
448	-al,-ation,-es,-fer,-ing,-ly,an-,dis-,off-,on-,par-,re-	The only hope now is that, following the elections, the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties.

1145	-ar,-ed,-ent,-ese,-fer,-in,al-,re-,un-	These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict, or perhaps we should already refer to it as "the undeclared World War III":
1146	-er,-icide,-ment,-st,sui-	*1. The first element is the suicide murder.*
1147	-ade,-en,-ey,-icide,-ion,-ly,-tion,-ular,be-,ex-,in-,on-	Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular, if I may use this expression, only lately.
1148	-en,-er,-es,-et,-on,-st,af-,under-	Even after September 11, it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon.
1149	-ent,-logical,-on,-ry,psycho-	It is a very potent psychological weapon.
1150	-al,-ly,-or,di-,im-,re-	Its real direct impact is relatively minor.
1151	-al,-an,-ar,-ee,-er,-es,-icide,-in,-ose,-st,ac-,sui-,to-,with-	The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents.
1152	-al,-an,-er,-es,-ess,-ly	September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
1153	-an,-ed,-icide,-ie,-le,al-,con-,di-,on-,sui-	More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya-based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started.
1154	-an,-ation,-ed,-icide,-le,-ose,-ry,-th,-tion,al-,di-,ever-,mon-,sui-	Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq.
1155	-icide,ab-,al-,sui-	So what is all the fuss about suicide killings?
1156	-es	It creates headlines.
1157	-ular	It is spectacular.
1158	-ing	It is frightening.
1159	-ed,-es,-ible,-ry,-th,an-,de-,dis-,in-	It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded.
1160	-ion,-ways,al-,de-,tele-	It is always shown on television in great detail.
1161	-age,-al,-an,-er,-ey,-ia,-id,-ile,-ism,-ite,-or,-ry,-th,an-,co-,de-,di-,ind-,to-	One such murder, with the help of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while, as it did in Bali and in Turkey.
1162	-al,-an,-ar,-ed,-er,-es,-icide,-ive,-st,ag-,an-,com-,de-,pre-,re-,sui-,un-	But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer.
1163	-ed,-et,-ing	This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World.
1164	-er,-ing,-ly,-st,Euro-,ag-,an-,con-,de-,im-,on-	The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder, not the next one.
1165	-est,-ity,-or,be-	We may arrange for the best airport security in the world.
1166	-ane,-ant,-ard,-er,-icide,-le,-ode,an-,ex-,sui-,wan-	But if you want to murder by suicide, you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people.
1167	-al,-ed,-er,-icide,-ine,-ing,-or,-st,co-,de-,meta-,mid-,sui-	Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector?
1168	-es,-kin,ab-,counter-	How about the lines to the check-in counters in a busy travel period?
1169	-al,-ation,-es,-et,-in,-ont,-or,-ry,an-,de-,ever-,meta-,ter-	Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses.
1170	-es,-ey,-ie,-ing,-ode,an-,con-,ex-,mal-,super-	Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters, concert halls, supermarkets, shopping malls, schools and hospitals.
1171	-all,-ed,-es,-et,-ine,-le,-ling,-ont,-ry,-ways,al-,an-,con-,ever-	Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target, not to speak of killing the guards themselves.
1172	-ability,-an,-ar,-ate,-er,-es,-in,-ive,-ly,an-,con-,de-,pre-,re-	You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way.
1173	-ar	And it is a war!
1174	-icide,be-,sui-	What is behind the suicide murders?
1175	-ed,-er,-ey,-ing,-ment,-ous,an-,col-,in-,mon-	Money is, money and power and cold-blooded murderous incitement, nothing else.
1176	-ic,-ing,-ious,-th,be-,re-	It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs.
1177	-er,pre-	No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up.
1178	-er,-ician,-ious,-on,re-	No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up.
1179	-ative,-ial,-one,an-,in-,re-	No relative of anyone influential has done it.
1180	-eme,-es,-ing,-ious,-ly,-ome,-or,ac-,ex-,in-,re-	Wouldn't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves, or to talk their sons into doing it, if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor?
1181	-ed,-en,-ent,-ey,-ing,be-,inter-	Aren't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven?
1182	-ad,-ed,-en,-ey,-ive,-le,-st,an-,in-,out-,re-	Instead, they send outcast women, naive children, retarded people and young incited hotheads.
1183	-ad,-al,-ed,-eme,-ent,-er,-es,-ey,-ise,-le,-ly,ac-,af-,an-,de-,en-,in-,sex-	They promise them the delights, mostly sexual, of the next world, and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead.
1184	-icide,-ing,-th,-ty,al-,an-,de-	Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair.
1185	-ar,-est,-ion,re-	The poorest region in the world, by far, is Africa.
1186	-er	It never happens there.
1187	-ate,-ent,-es,-le,-merous,an-,co-,con-,de-,di-	There are numerous desperate people in the world, in different cultures, countries and continents.
1188	-ance,-ation,-es,-ide,-one,-th,an-,ex-,re-,trans-	Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives, reconnaissance and transportation.
1189	-an,-ed,-ly,an-,de-,ex-,on-	There was certainly more despair in Saddam's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer's Iraq, and no one exploded himself.
1190	-al,-an,-ard,-ed,-en,-ent,-er,-ible,-icide,-ing,-ious,-ly,-on,-or,-ry,-th,af-,an-,co-,cyn-,in-,re-,sui-,ter-,well-	A suicide murder is simply a horrible, vicious weapon of cruel, inhuman, cynical, well-funded terrorists, with no regard to human life, including the life of their fellow countrymen, but with very high regard to their own affluent well-being and their hunger for power.
1191	-al,-ed,-es,-ive,-ly,-on,-ular,off-,on-	The only way to fight this new "popular" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas: the offensive way.
1192	-ase,-ed,-es,-ial,-id,-ive,an-,for-,off-,re-,to-,uni-	Like in the case of organized crime, it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid.
1193	-ate,-ed,-er,-et,-ing,-le,cor-,de-	You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner.
1194	-ad,-er,-ly,-st,af-	You must go after the head of the "Family".
1195	-able,-art,-ate,-ed,-hood,-ic,-id,-in,-ism,-ive,-ome,-ry,-ty,af-,an-,ex-,mis-,other-,par-,ter-,to-	If part of the public supports it, others tolerate it, many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood, organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism.
1196	-ed,-er,-es,af-,under-	The United States understands this now, after September 11.
1197	-ia,-ing,be-,under-	Russia is beginning to understand it.
1198	-ey,under-	Turkey understands it well.
1199	-es,-id,-ry,-st,Euro-,af-,under-	I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it.
1200	-er,-icide,-ive,-ly,Euro-,af-,bi-,on-,sui-,under-	Unfortunately, it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way.
1201	-en,-ion,-le,-ly,de-	In my humble opinion, this will definitely happen.
1202	-ing,-ish,-ly,an-,be-,on-	The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning.
1203	-able,-ed,-ing,-ity,-ly,-or,abs-,ind-,uni-	The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable.
1204	-ed,-es,-ity,Euro-,ac-,uni-	Until Europe wakes up, this unity will not be achieved.
1205	-ent,-es,-ly,in-,pre-	*2. The second ingredient is words, more precisely lies.*
1206	-al,-an	Words can be lethal.
1207	-ey,-le	They kill people.
1208	-al,-art,-en,-es,-id,-ie,-le,-ness,-st,al-,an-,diplo-,par-	It is often said that politicians, diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie, as part of their professional life.
1209	-al,-ate,-cy,-ed,-ics,-ing,-ion,-ish,-ment,-on,-th,ab-,abs-,an-,com-,de-,diplo-,in-,re-,to-	But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish, in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications, which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about.
1210	-an,-ation,-ed,-en,-er,-ible,-ish,-le,be-,in-	An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened, or was an American provocation or, even better, a Jewish plot.
1211	-ad,-ation,-en,-er,-es,-ess,-id,-ide,-ster,al-,an-,con-,for-,in-,pre-,re-	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information, Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad.
1212	-ar,-ation,-ed,-ic,ac-	Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic.
1213	-an,-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ing,-ion,-ly,-ous,af-,an-,be-,ever-,on-,pre-,re-,with-	But to stand, day after day, and to make such preposterous statements, known to everybody to be lies, without even being ridiculed in your own milieu, can only happen in this region.
1214	-able,-al,-id,-ing,-ly,-ome,-on,-ster,-ular,al-,be-,co-,di-,new-,re-	Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester, but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time.
1215	-ar,-en,-ence,-ent,-es,-ess,-ing,-ry,al-,ever-,pre-	It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence, every day, even now, to similar liars.
1216	-ant,-er,-ing,-ite,-le,al-,anti-,sub-,wan-	After all, if you want to be an anti-Semite, there are subtle ways of doing it.
1217	-ed,-er,-ish,-le,-st,an-,ex-,holo-	You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened, and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed.
1218	-ase,milli-,to-	But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case.
1219	-en,-er,-ese,-ey,-ia,co-,re-	When these same leaders make other statements, the Western media report them as if they could be true.
1220	-ance,-en,-ence,-es,-icide,-ing,-ish,-le,-ly,-ont,ac-,an-,be-,con-,dis-,par-,sui-	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance, arm and dispatch suicide murderers, condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras, talking to a world audience, which even partly believes them.
1221	-ar,-er,-est,-ic,-ine,-ing,-ish,-ite,-le,-ly,an-,re-	It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world.
1222	-ant,-ed,-es,-ful,-ie,-ing,-ment,-ome,-on,-or,-ose,ac-,an-,be-,de-,dis-,ever-,wan-	Incitement by Arab TV, accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies, has become a powerful weapon of those who lie, distort and want to destroy everything.
1223	-ation,-ed,-en,-es,-le,-ly,ad-,an-,be-,de-	Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so-called martyrs, and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows.
1224	-en,-ic,-st,re-,under-	I recommend to you, even though most of you do not understand Arabic, to watch Al Jazeera, from time to time.
1225	-es,be-	You will not believe your own eyes.
1226	-er,-le,al-,sub-	But words also work in other ways, more subtle.
1227	-al,-ar,-ation,-ed,-es,-ess,-icide,-in,-ing,an-,de-,pre-,re-,sui-	A demonstration in Berlin, carrying banners supporting Saddam's regime and featuring three-year old babies dressed as suicide murderers, is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "peace demonstration".
1228	-ar,-en,-fer,-in,-ose,ac-,bi-,re-,to-	You may support or oppose the Iraq war, but to refer to fans of Saddam, Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much.
1229	-an,-ant,-en,-ent,-es,-ing,-le,-th,ad-,an-,bi-,in-,mid-,re-	A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day, eats, observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill.
1230	-ant,-en,-ing,-le,-ling,-th,an-,in-,re-	She then blows herself up, killing 20 people, including many children, with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant.
1231	-al,-ean,-ed,-ess,-ist,Euro-,ac-,an-,pre-	She is called "martyr" by several Arab leaders and "activist" by the European press.
1232	-ed,-er,-es,-ey,-ly,ac-,an-,be-,con-,mon-	Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows.
1233	-ad,-al,-ary,-ation,-ed,-er,-ing,ac-,an-,equi-,on-,to-	There is a new game in town: The actual murderer is called "the military wing", the one who pays him, equips him and sends him is now called "the political wing" and the head of the operation is called the "spiritual leader".
1234	-ed,-er,-es,-ia,-ian,-ly,-merous,-or,-ry,-ture,al-,ever-,exa-,on-,ter-	There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature, used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media.

1578	-ance,-in,-ing,-ory,an-,in-,inter-,on-,sub-,un-	The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7/24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit.
1579	-ate,-ed,-er,-es,-ist,-st,ag-,an-,col-,dis-,sui-	A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004.

1582	-al,-er,-es,-est,-ian,-ing,-ly,-ory,-th,-tion,ad-,be-,circum-,co-,con-,ir-,under-	The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory, with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances.

1584	-arch,-en,-er,-es,-ly,-ory,-st,ab-,bio-,in-,like-,re-	A search of Dr. Ken Berry's residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory.
1585	-ed,-en,-es,-ess,-ing,-or,-ose,be-,ex-,in-,off-,pre-	Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him.

2109	-age,-al,-ate,-er,-ess,-et,-ing,-ome,-ry,-st,ab-,an-,ap-,de-,en-,mes-,pre-,re-	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery.
2110	-ent,-er,-ly,-ry,-ure,de-,full-,in-,under-	On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.
2111	-ation,-ed,-ent,-er,-le,-on,-tion,ad-,an-,in-,un-	Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be sent)?
2112	-ad,-ed,-er,-le,-tion,in-	Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?
2113	-age,-al,-ard,-ation,-ed,-es,-ey,-ing,-ity,-ry,-th,-ture,ac-,an-,ap-,com-,en-,ever-,in-,mes-,on-,re-	With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.
2114	-ed,-ency,-ese,-ing,-le,-ment,-on,-th,-ure,-wide,ab-,an-,be-,con-,en-,im-,to-	With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.
2115	-able,-al,-ard,-ed,-ese,-ing,-ly,-ness,-on,-th,al-,de-,en-,ex-,re-	These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.

2118	-al,-ed,-ent,-er,-ing,-ness,-on,-or,-st,af-,al-,an-,be-,com-,con-,re-,to-	The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers.
2119	-an,-ed,-ese,-ite,-ness,-ont,-wide,al-,an-,be-,con-,im-,re-,under-	I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.
2120	-al,-art,-ese,-ess,-ing,-ive,-le,-st,-tion,ag-,an-,be-,ex-,par-,re-,to-	And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.
2121	-al,-ar,-ey,-ick,-ment,-tion,com-,en-,re-	My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year.
2122	-able,-en,-ent,-es,-ify,-ing,-ity,-ling,-or,an-,com-,con-,de-,re-	There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.
2123	-ed,-en,-es,-ing,-th,al-,an-,be-,com-	Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New.
2124	-al,-an,-ant,-er,-et,-ish,-st,-tion,ab-,ag-,in-,re-,wan-	So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.
2125	-al,-ate,-en,-er,-ese,-ful,-in,-ing,-ly,-ment,-st,-tion,-wide,af-,an-,ap-,com-,ex-,re-	Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?

2165	-al,-an,-er,-ey,-ing,-ling,-ome,an-,bi-,con-,over-	At this point, our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems.
2166	-ant,-er,-es,im-,is-	There are still four important issues, however:
2167	-es,-ing,acro-,com-,mes-,trans-	IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains.
2168	-ed,-es,-ide,-in,-ization,-ness,-on,-or,an-,ent-,in-,mes-,out-,re-,uni-	This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain.
2169	-ad,-age,-ary,-es,-ic,-ization,-less,-ol,-ry,agr-,an-,de-,in-,mes-,re-,to-,un-	No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic instead.
2170	-ate,-ed,-ic,al-,com-,de-,re-	WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a separate company.
2171	-ade,-ed,-er,-es,-ey,-ol,-ous,ano-,be-,in-,re-,to-	HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous.
2172	-an,-ed,-ol,-ous,al-,ano-,ex-,to-	HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys.
2173	-age,-ator,-ed,-ent,-er,-es,-ey,-in,-ive,-ly,-or,ad-,af-,al-,de-,mes-	Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator.
2174	-ad,-an,-ar,-er,-es,-ese,-et,-ey,-in,-ing,-th,an-,con-,dis-,em-,ex-,mes-,re-,with-	Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later (as they can with e-mail).
2175	-age,-al,-ed,-ly,-or,an-,be-,co-,dis-,ent-,ex-,mes-,mis-,off-,re-	This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned.
2176	-ative,-ey,-ial,-in,-ing,-ship,com-,in-	The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but they lack commercial sponsorship.
2177	-est,-ey,-ing,-ly,-ol,-or,-wide,allo-,be-,bi-,com-,full-,im-,to-	They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company-wide.

3805	-ed,-es,-ing,-ion,-ish,-le,-ly,-ment,-th,al-,auto-,con-	Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.

3807	-ed,-es,-ing,-ist,-st,-th,-ure,ab-,be-,co-	We will fight with them about who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost.
3808	-an,-ation,-ean,-ed,-et,-gate,-ing,-le,-ture,-ure,co-,ever-	In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.

3810	-age,-an,-ation,-ed,-et,-ing,ex-,ful-	We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.
3811	-ad,-ard,-ate,-en,-ence,-es,-ess,-ey,-ity,abs-,ac-,agr-,an-,be-,com-,con-,de-,hol-,in-,on-	James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.
3812	-an,-et,-ey,-ing,-tion,-ure,an-,ex-	That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution.
3815	-es	James Centilli
3817	-ad,-ase,-ion,-ment,-ol,an-,con-,re-	Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management.
3818	-ad,-er,-ess,-ide,-ile,-ine,-ing,-ion,-oid,-or,ac-,com-,deci-,on-,under-	My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak load periods.
3819	-al,-ar,-ation,-ed,-er,-ess,-ly,-or,-ric,-st,ac-,ad-,co-,electr-,in-,re-	We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of July through September.
3820	-al,-ar,-ed,-en,-er,-et,-le,-or,-st,ab-,be-,co-,in-,re-	Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.
3821	-er,-ing,-or,-st,-th,an-,co-,com-,con-,mon-	This cost is averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September.
3822	-able,-ary,-ed,-ing,-ity,al-,an-,be-,bi-,co-,com-	Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.
3823	-ad,-ate,-ed,-ent,-es,-ey,-id,-one,-or,al-,an-,bi-,co-,de-,di-,sub-,wan-	They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so.
3824	-id,-ing,-ly,-one,-st,an-,bi-,di-,im-	None of them did, and most importantly, the winning bidders did not.
3825	-ate,-ed,-er,-es,-ly,-ment,agr-,al-	Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates.
3826	-age,-an,-ed,-et,-ey,-th,an-,mes-	I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down?
3828	-age,-ate,-ed,-en,-et,-ing,-less,-ly,-ment,-one,-st,-th,agr-,an-,ap-,be-,contra-,dis-,for-,un-,under-	I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to.
3829	-age,-ate,-ed,-ent,-es,-ey,-id,-ing,-ly,-one,-st,-th,ad-,an-,ap-,be-,bi-,co-,con-,di-,ever-	My concern with adding the language below is, could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate??

4579	-al,-ic,-or,-ture,over-,to-	As an overview, this proposal: * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007. *
4580	-an,-ation,-er,-es,-or,-st,en-,to-,trans-	* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today. *

4585	-able,-al,-ant,-ed,-es,-ly,-or,-st,-trophic,ad-,co-,in-,on-,re-	The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events. *
4586	-an,-ate,-en,-ent,-es,-ess,-ial,al-,an-,be-,di-	* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential. *

4636	-able,-ad,-ary,-ase,-ate,-ed,-ence,-est,-fic,-ing,-st,ac-,an-,de-,in-,re-,sub-	instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "modest" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings, not just determined by whim.
4637	-al,-ee,-ive,-ly,-th,agr-,an-,gen-,over-,pre-	In general, we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that.
4638	-ed,-ly,-wise,ex-	Otherwise, I think you have captured the points excellently.

4640	-able,-ad,-ed,-ile,-ion,-ome,-or,-wise,an-,dis-,other-,wan-	But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.
4641	-er,-ing,-or,-ure,in-,pre-	OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for "price gouging" is increasing.
4642	-all,-ation,-ent,-ing,ad-,be-	The administration is hell bent on finding a "fall guy."
4643	-al,-ant,-ed,-es,-or,-ose,an-,re-,wan-	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out.
4644	-all,-ase,-ed,-ess,-ing,-or,pre-,re-	His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "refunds."
4645	-ant,-ed,-er,-ey,-ly,-th,-ward,an-,contra-,de-,for-	On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers.
4646	-eme,ex-,re-	And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme.
4647	-al,-an,-ative,-crat,-ed,-er,-ing,-ling,-on,-or,an-,con-,de-,re-	At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds.
4648	-ed,-gon,-ing	Bilbray joined the "gouging" band wagon.
4649	-al,-ation,-ed,-es,-ly,-th,dis-,in-,re-	The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "real" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works.
4650	-ed,-ide,-ive,-lysis,an-,ana-,com-,re-	On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel.
4651	-ant,-es,-et,-ible,-id,-le,-ly,-ture,em-,im-,par-	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit.
4652	-ed,-es,-est,-ing,-st,-ture,actin-,al-,em-,ever-,in-,re-,self-	He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure.
4653	-ed,-ent,-er,-ing,-on,-or,be-,under-	IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered.
4654	-ase,-es,-est,-ing,-or,be-,re-,sub-	In the best case, the clamoring for a "refund" subsides.
4655	-al,-ase,-ed,-er,-ing,-ly,-on,-st,be-,co-,in-,inter-,on-,under-	In which case, the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered.
4656	-ase,-ed,-es,-ia,-ium,-on,an-,con-,ex-,in-,other-	In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) "played by the rules," but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.
4657	-ure	You're right, Sue.
4658	-ant,-ate,-er,-es,-ing,-ome,dec-,ov-	Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion---trying to finesse it.

5103	-age,-art,-ate,-ed,-ee,-er,-ergy,-es,-et,-ey,-id,-ine,-ing,-ity,ac-,an-,com-,con-,de-,electr-,en-,mani-,off-,sub-,to-	A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.
5104	-all,-ate,-ative,-ean,-ed,-ee,-en,-es,-ing,-ol,-st,-th,an-,co-,com-,en-,in-,twi-	The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup."
5105	-an,-ate,-ed,-er,-ergy,-es,-ia,-id,-ing,-mer,-ness,-or,-ped,al-,an-,bi-,con-,di-,en-,in-	Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.
5106	-al,-ator,-ed,-en,-ent,-er,-ey,-one,-ry,-tion,ac-,al-,be-,centr-,co-,de-,gen-,pre-,re-,step-,to-	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.
5107	-age,-ard,-ed,-en,-er,-est,an-,de-,inter-,re-	Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.
5108	-ed,-en,-ese,-id,-ome,-ont,co-,con-,with-	"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn.
5109	-al,-ed,-ee,-er,-ide,-ing,-ose,ab-,an-,com-,em-,for-,in-,ov-,sub-	The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos.
5110	-an,-ed,-er,-id,-or,ac-,be-	Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter.
5111	-ant,-ed,-en,-es,-id,-ing,-ment,-or,be-,de-,in-	"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said.
5112	-ed,-er,-ic,-ing,-ment,al-,com-,off-,re-	Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office.
5113	-al,-an,-ee,-id,com-,con-	ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct.
5114	-ade,-al,-er,-ion,-ment,-th,deci-,on-,up-	The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on.
5115	-er,-ia,-ing,be-,gen-,re-	At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps.
5116	-an,-ency,-id,em-	"It was an emergency," Fishman said.
5117	-ad,-tion,ac-	"We had to take action.''
5118	-an,-ard,-ed,-en,-er,-ey,-ity,-or,be-,co-,electr-,mon-,re-	What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power.
5119	-en,-er,-es,-ive,-ly,be-,mega-,mon-,re-	The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier.
5120	-an,-arch,-ed,-ee,-en,-ey,-id,-ing,-ity,-ose,an-,be-,com-,electr-,gen-,in-,to-	"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.
5121	-ose	"All hell broke loose.''
5122	-al,-an,-atory,-ed,-er,-ergy,-ing,-ion,-ity,-th,an-,de-,electr-,gen-	Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed.
5123	-ed,-ent,-er,-in,-ix,al-,an-,gen-,re-,with-	The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.
5124	-ability,-ad,-all,-ed,-en,-ent,-er,-ergy,-et,-ing,-ion,-ity,-le,-ly,-ment,an-,con-,gen-,im-,in-,on-,re-	"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.
5125	-al,-ar,-ation,-ed,-er,-ergy,-es,-ing,-st,ab-,ac-,actin-,ag-,an-,be-,co-,en-,gen-,ill-,off-,to-	Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials.
5126	-ade,-al,-ate,-ed,-er,-es,-id,-in,-ine,-ion,-ix,col-,de-,sub-	He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.
5127	-ad,-al,-ed,-ent,-ergy,-et,-ity,col-,electr-,en-,off-,re-,to-	In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.
5128	gen-	The generators got their way.
5129	-al,-an,-ed,-ing,-ion,com-	The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan.
5130	-ed,-er,-ive,mon-	What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.
5131	-ed,-en,-er,-ese,-ey,-ing,-ling,-tion,-ward,at-,co-,con-,to-,un-	Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints.
5132	-age,-an,-ed,-ency,-er,-ey,-ia,-ly,-or,-st,an-,be-,dec-,em-,with-	They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted.
5133	-al,-ed,-ergy,-ment,-or,an-,con-,en-	What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.
5134	-age,-al,-ed,-ency,-ent,-er,-est,-ing,-ish,-tion,ab-,an-,em-,off-,pre-,re-,sub-	Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap.
5135	-al,-ed,-er,-ing,-ity,-ment,-th,aut-,ov-,re-	Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government.
5136	-ad,-ard,-ed,-en,-er,-or,ac-,be-,re-,un-	Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed.
5137	-ade,-ard,-ency,-es,-est,-ey,-ing,-ling,-on,-or,-ped,-st,-th,an-,atto-,be-,em-,re-	In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made.
5138	-ing,-tion,ab-,an-,di-	He didn't mention anything about it.
5139	-id,-on,re-,to-	"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said.
5140	-al,-ed,-er,-ing,-one,-th,co-,gen-,re-	With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.
5141	-er,-ergy,-es,-ey,-id,-ing,-ment,-th,ab-,ad-,en-,exa-	"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said.
5142	-ant,-ed,-ey,-ing,-tion,be-	"It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant.
5143	-ate,-cy,-ed,-es,-ing,-ness,-or,-tion,-ward,ac-,an-,for-,in-,to-	This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business."
5144	-age,-ee,-es,-in,-ity,-or,-ped,electr-,mega-,re-,with-	Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show.
5145	-ed,-es,-ing,-ion,-ity,-or,be-,bi-,electr-,ex-,over-,re-	Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.
5146	-an,-ed,-er,-est,-id,-ling,-on,-ped,af-,re-	Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians.
5147	-es,-id,di-,re-	Prices, he said, did not spike as a result.
5148	-ad,-al,-ate,-ed,-er,-ey,-ing,-ity,electr-,gen-	Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.
5149	-al,-ed,-en,-ency,-er,-es,-id,-ity,-on,-or,-ure,allo-,electr-,em-,off-,over-,re-	Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.
5150	-ed,-id,-on,-tion,ac-,ad-,be-,con-,to-	"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said.
5151	-ade,-ation,-ed,-ial,-id,be-,di-	"In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation.
5152	-ade,-ed,-er,-ess,-or,an-,be-,in-,re-	We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund."
5153	-an,-ard,-er,-es,-id,-ing,-ive,-or,ab-,an-,con-,di-,ex-,gen-,re-	Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap.
5154	-ed,-es,-id,-ing,-ity,-one,-ware,al-,an-,be-,com-,con-,un-	Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.
5155	-ent,-ergy,-es,-id,-ive,-or,-ry,di-,ex-	"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.
5156	-ad,-er,-id,-ing,-one,di-	"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."
5157	-ard,-ed,-ency,-er,-in,-ing,ac-,de-,em-,ex-	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions.
5158	-ad,-an,-ard,-ed,-er,-id,-ome,-tion,ac-,con-,re-	Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.
5159	-al,-an,-atory,-ed,-er,-ergy,-es,-ing,-ion,-mer,al-,an-,de-,deci-,for-	James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.
5160	-ed,-ency,-er,-et,-ey,-ia,-id,-tion,ab-,an-,em-	"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said.
5161	-ator,-ent,-ey,-id,-ment,an-,di-,ind-	"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."
5162	-ed,-ee,-es,-ese,al-,com-,trans-	What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired.
5163	-al,-es,-ide,ac-,an-,be-,em-	He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.
5164	-er,-id,-ont,di-	"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said.
5165	-ade,-est,-id,-ling,-ment,-ry,inter-	"Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''
5166	-all,-et,-ing,-oid,an-,at-,on-,re-	We should resurrect Mike Smith's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.

5192	-ation,-er,-ey,-ic,-ly,-or,-ose,-ship,an-,contra-,eco-,is-,on-,un-	Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP (the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract.

6008	-ation,-ed	This is called ideation.

6010	-ess,-etic,-ing,-tion,de-,in-,syn-	Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process.
6011	-al,-ate,-ess,-ing,-ism,-le,-th,an-,ana-,in-,trans-	Whereas, trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process.

6029	-age,-al,-an,-ar,-ative,-ed,-en,-ible,-ide,-ion,-or,-st,-tion,-ure,al-,be-,de-,is-,re-	A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session, so there is a real need for visible support for the “pro-same-gender-marriage” side of this issue.
6030	-ary,-ation,-ed,-es,-ing,-ly,-ry,ad-,un-	At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration.
6031	-ation,-ed,-on,-or,al-,an-	Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the Declaration.
6032	-ation,-ed,-ite,-ly,-or,-ry,con-,in-,un-	Furthermore, the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration.
6033	-age,-an,-ation,-en,-er,-es,-ing,-ious,-le,-or,-th,-tion,com-,con-	(Since the Declaration is written as coming from “religious leaders,” people who don’t consider themselves “religious leaders” can sign as “Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality.”)

6051	-age,-al,-es,-ial,-ic,-ly,-ose,ac-,an-,eco-,in-,re-	Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice.

6071	-al,-ancy,-ard,-ed,-eme,-ent,-er,-es,-ment,-ome,ano-,be-,re-	As many of you may have heard, President Bush has nominated a long-time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court, to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court.

6083	-ent,-es	President Bush loves him.
6084	-eme,-es,-ey,-le,-ome,-ont	Yes, it is true that some people don't like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court.
6085	-er,-es,-ey,-le,-or,-ose,an-,on-,out-	But other people do like the way they think he will vote, and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him.
6086	-al,-an,-ate,-ed,-er,-es,-ing,-ment,-on,-one,-or,an-,ap-,re-	So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon, on whether to approve him or not; and at this moment (evening of Jan. 27, 2006) it looks like he has more than the fifty-one votes needed for approval.
6087	-ad,-ed,-eme,-ent,-er,-es,-et,-ing,-ly,-ry,an-,be-,inter-,wan-	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court, to be judging the cases Bush is interested in.

6092	-ic,be-	And because of this tragic flaw . . .
6093	-ar,-ent,-er,-es,-ing	"He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances, Giving Far Too Much Power To The President."
6094	-al,-ative,-ee,-es,-ial,-ive,-ment,an-	In our Constitutional system, we have three branches of the Federal Government: the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches.
6095	-an,-er,-es,-ic,-ment,an-,be-,hol-,on-	And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy, the other two can hold it down.

6097	-art,-ary,-ate,-ity,-ive,ent-,par-	The Military is not part of the Executive Branch: it is a separate entity.
6098	-ary,-ator,-ean,-ed,-eme,-er,-ess,-ing,-ive,-ly,-st,-th,al-,an-,ex-,re-	"Commander In Chief" doesn't mean that he is the boss of the Military, merely that he is the Administrator, just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch, charged with "executing faithfully" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court.
6099	-al,-ary,-eme,-ent,-er,-es,-ess,-ity,-ive,-less,-ory,-th,ac-,agr-,an-,aut-,un-	Under the Unitary Executive Theory, the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them.
6100	-al,-eme,-ent,-er,-ess,-ity,-ome,-th,ad-,an-,aut-,be-,ov-,re-	And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President, with no real authority over him.
6101	-al,-ator,-ed,-ent,-er,-es,-ing,-ly,-ol,-tion,an-,be-,con-,ent-,un-	And the President becomes a Dictator, unrestrained by anything in the Constitution, backed up by the Armed Forces, which would be entirely under his personal control.
6102	-an,-ar,-ary,-ed,-ee,-er,-es,-ing,-ist,-ly,-ome,-ship,-st,ano-,be-	And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship, no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II.

6195	-al,-ation,-ed,-er,-es,-et,-or,-ose,-ure,ab-,an-,aut-	I'm not sure if any of you know much about civet cats, but to brief those who might not know, I will quote James Rachels, author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights-related books and articles.
6196	-al,-an,-ed,-ee,-er,-ism,-or,-ory,an-,ap-,non-	(I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non-human animals).

6201	-all,-ed,-es,-et,-ide,-ped,-ture,an-,in-	Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds, where the temperature is kept up to 110 F by fires.
6202	-ed,-ey,-ie,-ly,con-,di-,un-	They are confined in this way until they finally die.
6203	-ary,-es,-ment,extra-,mis-	What justifies this extraordinary mistreatment?
6204	-ance,-ese,-ful,-ture,an-,mis-,sub-	These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume.

6206	-es,-tion,in-	(The heat increases their "production" of musk.)
6207	-ance,-ed,-ly,-th,ap-,en-,mani-	Here Kant's rule--"Animals are merely means to an end; that end is man"--is applied with a vengeance.
6208	-ed,-es,-ial,-ole,-or,-st,an-,inter-,on-,to-,tri-	To promote one of the most trivial interests we have, thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives."

6828	-an,-ing,-ly	Attack on Iran: A Looming Folly
6830	-ive	t r u t h o u t | Perspective
6831	-ary	Monday 09 January 2006
6832	-an,-ar,-ation,-en,-es,-ing,-th,ad-,at-,be-,re-	The wires have been humming since before the New Year with reports that the Bush administration is planning an attack on Iran.
6833	-an,-ar,-ary,-ation,-ed,-er,-es,-ia,-ible,-ing,-ish,-or,-st,-th,ac-,ad-,ag-,al-,pre-,re-	"The Bush administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year, according to German media reports, reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the Turkish media," reported UPI on December 30th.
6834	-ad,-ary,-ed,-en,-ence,-er,-es,-in,-ine,-ing,-ly,al-,be-,con-,in-,re-	"The Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week," continued UPI, "quoted 'NATO intelligence sources' who claimed that the NATO allies had been informed that the United States is currently investigating all possibilities of bringing the mullah-led regime into line, including military options.
6835	-cy,-ed,-en,-ent,-ine,-ly,-st,al-,be-,mon-	This 'all options are open' line has been President George W Bush's publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months."
6836	-ation,-er,-ly,at-,de-,exa-	An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order.
6838	-ed,-eme,-ent,-ic,-ist,-ite,-ly,-or,-tion,-ty,an-,re-	The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi'ite organizations, principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI).
6839	-al,-an,-es,-ist,-ite,-ship,-th,an-,con-,deca-,um-	Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi'ite leadership in Iran that go back decades.
6840	-an,-ant,-ence,-ment,-tion	In essence, Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government.
6841	-an,-ary,-ate,-ed,-eme,-es,-st,-tion,ac-,ag-,an-,ex-,im-,under-	Should the United States undertake military action against Iran, the ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme.
6842	-ary,-ed,-en,-er,-pter,-st,ano-,be-,com-,de-,heli-	In the first eight days of January, eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq, compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday.
6843	-al,-an,-ed,-ence,-er,-es,-ing,-le,-ment,-st,an-,be-,com-,dis-,for-,hol-	Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias, believe the last elections were a sham, and hold little political power in the government.
6844	-able,-al,-an,-ed,-es,-ite,al-,at-,for-,re-	If the US attacks Iran, it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi'ite factions loyal to Iran.
6845	-ation,-ed,-er,-es,-ey,-ian,-ic,-ing,-ment,-ry,-st,an-,for-,in-,re-	The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties, US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases, and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power.
6846	-er,-ing,-on,al-,in-	Iraq, already a seething cauldron, will sink further into chaos.
6848	-al,-an,-ed,-en,-ent,-es,-ing,-like,-ling,-st,an-,at-,con-,for-,re-	Unlike Iraq, Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions, repeated attacks, and two American-led wars.
6849	-al,-ar,-ary,-ation,-ed,-ial,-ile,-ing,-less,-st,-th,an-,con-,de-,en-,non-,re-,sub-	While Iran's conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran-Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless.
6850	-al,-an,-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ic,-ing,-ome,-or,an-,is-,ov-,re-,un-	According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004, Iran "has some 540,000 men under arms and over 350,000 reserves.
6851	-al,-ary,-ed,-ey,-ian,-or,an-,in-	They include 120,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare.
6852	-ary,-ed,-er,-es,-in,-ing,-ious,-le,-ry,al-,amphi-,an-,at-,com-,heli-,hol-,in-,sub-	Iran's military also includes holdings of 1,613 main battle tanks, 21,600 other armored fighting vehicles, 3,200 artillery weapons, 306 combat aircraft, 60 attack helicopters, 3 submarines, 59 surface combatants, and 10 amphibious ships."
6853	-ability,-al,-an,-ant,-ary,-ed,-er,-es,-ly,con-,on-,re-	"Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability," continued the CSIS report.
6854	-al,-an,-ant,-ation,-es,-metric,-or,ad-,an-	"Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare, and poses the additional threat of proliferation.
6855	-able,-ence,-ile,-ing,-th,-tion,an-,con-,de-,for-,mis-	There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long-range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction.
6856	-al,-ed,-er,-logical,-ly,an-,bio-,chemi-,dec-,hol-,un-	It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons, and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown."
6857	-an,-ary,-ed,-en,-ian,-ide,-ly,-tion,astr-,be-,con-,is-,re-	A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports, "Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf, Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf.
6858	-an,-ate,-ed,-er,-ing,-ion,-ly,al-,re-,trans-	The so called 'Tanker' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region.
6859	-able,-ade,-al,-all,-an,-ar,-en,-es,-ian,-ics,-ing,-ite,-ive,-st,ag-,an-,co-,en-	Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping, and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective."
6860	-ed,-ing,-ity,an-,con-,ex-	"More concerning," continued the MILNET brief, "is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy.
6861	-an,-ed,-es,-et,-ia,-ile,-ing,-ise,-ization,-merous,-ol,-ship,-some,-st,-th,an-,anti-,in-,mid-,mis-,re-,sub-	The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect, anti-shipping cruise missiles: 'Iran has obtained new anti-ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China, midget submarines from North Korea, submarines from Russia, and modern mines.'"
6862	-an,-es,-est,-ile,-ly,-or,-ose,con-,for-,mis-	It is Iran's missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf, especially for the US Navy.
6863	-al,-all,-ed,-es,-ian,-ing,-on,-ose,-st,an-,co-,for-,up-	Iran's coast facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters.
6864	-ed,-ian,-ine,-ly,-ous,al-,co-,ex-,on-	The Gulf itself only has one exit, the Strait of Hormuz, which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline.
6865	-an,-ence,hol-	In essence, Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf.
6866	-ed,-es,-et,-ile,-ise,-ose,-th,an-,be-,co-,de-	Missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below.
6867	-ade,-es,-ment,-ous,-st,al-,mis-	Of all the missiles in Iran's armament, the most dangerous is the Russian-made SS-N-22 Sunburn.
6868	-es,-ese,-est,-et,-ly,-ship,anti-,mis-	These missiles are, simply, the fastest anti-ship weapons on the planet.
6869	-an,-tude,al-,re-	The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude.
6870	-ade,-an,-ed,-ee,-es,-ome,-on,-ster,-tude	Its maximum low-altitude speed is Mach 2.2, some three times faster than the American-made Harpoon.
6871	-er,-es,co-,ful-	The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range.
6872	-ate,-er,-es,-ive,-le,-on,an-,co-,de-,mis-,on-,to-	The missile's manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer, and five missiles could sink a 20,000 ton ship.
6873	-et,-ile,-or,al-,mis-,super-	The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile.
6874	-all,-ling,-ped	Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987, killing 37 sailors.
6875	-ee,co-	The Stark could not see them to stop them.
6876	-ard,-ed,-er,-ian,-ly,-ome,-th,ab-,de-	The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf, with some 7,000 souls aboard.
6877	-ary,-es,-in,-ling,-or,-th,an-,in-	Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force, which includes the USS Tarawa, the USS Austin, and the USS Pearl Harbor.
6878	-ed,-in,-wise,de-,like-	The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf.
6879	-age,-an,-ar,-ate,-ed,-er,-es,-ese,-ible,-ile,-in,-ity,-oid,-th,-tion,ab-,af-,an-,at-,de-,in-,mis-,re-,ter-,with-	The Sunburn missile, with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection, would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders.
6880	-al,-an,-ary,-ibility,-ing,-le,in-,on-	Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq.
6881	-al,-all,-ed,-es,-ide,-ing,-ly,an-,at-	Currently, the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms, shoulder-fired grenades and roadside bombs.
6882	-an,-ary,-ed,an-,de-,for-	The vaunted American military has suffered 2,210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare.
6883	-an,-ar,-ation,-ed,-ome,be-	The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war, a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days.
6884	-ably,-an,-ation,-ed,-es,-ing,-le,-ly,-ome,-st,-th,al-,an-,be-,co-,deci-,di-,in-,milli-,un-	If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicles, along with any or all of its nearly million-strong army, into the Iraq fray, the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire.
6885	-ian,-tion	3.  The Syrian Connection
6886	-al,-an,-ary,-ed,-es,-ia,-ion,-on,-tion,agr-,an-,com-,prot-,re-,up-	In February of 2005, Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "challenges and threats" in the region.
6887	-an,-ation,-ed,-en,-er,-ese,-fic,-ia,-ion,-ly,-ster,-th,-tion,af-,an-,con-,de-,in-,re-	This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq, and a reaction to America's condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus.
6888	-ably,-al,-an,-er,-es,-ia,-ing,-th,an-,at-,co-,con-,de-,di-,for-,in-,tri-	An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact, and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American forces.
6889	-an,-ary,-ing	Like Iran, Syria's military is nothing to scoff at.
6890	-ary,-er,-est,-ia,-ible,-ing,-le,-ly,-lysis,-ry,-st,af-,ana-,ever-,for-	Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel.
6891	-ant,-ary,-en,-ent,-es,-ing,-on,-or,-th,be-,counter-,in-,over-,up-	Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel's overwhelming capabilities.
6892	-ability,-ad,-er,-ia,-ive,-ome,-ry,an-,un-	As of 2002, Syria had some 215,000 soldiers under arms, 4,700 tanks, and a massive artillery capability.
6893	-ar,-ed,-en,-er,-ian,-ling,an-,com-,to-	The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter/attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons, totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft.
6894	-ed,-es,-est,-ia,-ion,-istic,-ly,al-,com-,mis-,on-,re-	Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region, comprised primarily of SCUD-derived systems.
6895	-an,-art,-en,-es,-ling,-th,an-,be-	Iran, North Korea and China have been willing providers of state-of-the-art technologies.
6896	-ability,-al,-ed,-ia,-ian,-ing,-ion,-st,ad-,chemi-,well-	Compounding this is the well-based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf.
6897	-nomy,an-	4.  China and the US Economy
6898	-an,-ed,-es,-ian,-ile,-le,-ment,-on,-ous,al-,an-,at-,com-,en-,in-,mis-	While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos, missiles in the Gulf, and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran, all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US/Iran engagement.
6899	-al,-ed,-ing,-ly,-nomy,-or,-ry,-st,an-,eco-,ex-,ind-,on-	China's economy is exploding, hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry.
6900	-al,-an,-ed,-ian,-ion,-or,-st,-th,an-,bi-,de-,in-,mon-	In the last several months, China has inked deals with Iran for $70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas.
6901	-al,-an,-ase,-ed,-er,-ion,-ive,an-,bar-,de-,milli-,ov-,re-,to-	China will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years, will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran, and will receive 150,000 barrels of oil per day from that field.
6902	-an,-ed,-er,-ian,-ine,-ing,-th,-tion,ano-,con-	China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea, where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China.
6903	-an,-ed,-ic,-th,at-,co-,di-,eco-	Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health.
6904	-al,-ed,-er,-ian,-ing,an-,im-	Further, any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tankers running China's liquefied natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz.
6905	-al,-an,-ant,-ate,-cide,-ed,-st,-th,ag-,an-,de-,deci-,re-	Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran, the US would be faced with a significant threat.
6906	-an,-ary,-ation,-fic,-ly,co-,con-,ex-,for-	This threat exists not merely on a military level, though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan.
6907	-an,-ly,-nomy,-tion,eco-,hol-	More significantly, China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand.
6908	-ade,-an,-ar,-ative,-ed,-ent,-es,-ese,-id,-ing,-ion,-ly,-ment,-or,-th,ap-,hol-,re-,tri-	Paul Craig Roberts, writing for The American Conservative, said in July of 2005 that "As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States, the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $1 trillion.
6909	-ation,-ion,-ly,ac-,ap-,bi-	China's accumulation of dollars is approximately $600 billion.
6910	-ion,-th,ab-,bi-,hol-	South Korea holds about $200 billion.
6911	-age,-ed,-er,-es,-ese,-ive,-ous,co-,en-,ov-	These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States.
6912	-ar,-er,-es,-ese,-est,-ing,-ome,-tion,-ure,an-,co-,in-,inter-,pre-,re-,un-	By dumping some portion of their reserves, these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U.S. interest rates skyrocketing.
6913	-an,-er,-le,-ly,-on,-or,-th,-tion,ac-,an-,exa-,hol-,ov-,re-	Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action, but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan, for example - China holds the cards.
6914	-an,-ar,-es,-ey,an-,re-	China and Japan, and the world at large, have more dollar reserves than they require.
6915	-ed,-er,-ey,-ic,-ing,-on,-ose,super-	They would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose."
6916	-all,-ed,-en,-ency,-es,-est,con-,re-	"The hardest blow on Americans," concluded Roberts, "will fall when China does revalue its currency.
6917	-ade,-an,-art,-ed,-en,-ency,-ent,-es,-ey,under-	When China's currency ceases to be undervalued, American shoppers in Wal-Mart, where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China, will think they are in Neiman Marcus.
6918	-al,-an,-es,-ic,-tion,in-,re-	Price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in American real incomes.
6919	-an,-ence,-es,-est,-et,-ing,-ion,-th,an-,co-,con-,ex-,inter-	If this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market, American consumers will experience the hardest times since the Great Depression."
6920	-an,-nomy,eco-	In short, China has the American economy by the throat.
6921	-cide,-ey,al-,deci-	Should they decide to squeeze, we will all feel it.
6922	-an,-ed,-en,-ent,-er,-es,-ic,-ity,-st,ac-,ag-,an-,co-,diplo-,ex-,re-	China's strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States.
6923	-an,-ness	5.  American Preparedness
6924	-an,-ary,-en,-es,-ome,-or,an-,deca-,over-	American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield.
6925	-ar,-ed,-id,-ing,-ory,-st,-tion	The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception.
6926	-ation,-ee,-ence,-er,-ped,-st,con-	The last three years of the Iraq occupation, however, have sapped this confidence.
6927	-age,-an,-ary,-ase,-ation,-ence,-ing,-one,-th,con-,dec-	Worse, the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the American military, justifying the decrease in confidence.
6928	-an,-ed,-ing,al-,an-,de-,re-	Thanks to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, recruiting is at an all-time low.
6929	-al,-ing,-ist,-th,an-,re-	Soldiers with vital training and know-how are refusing to re-enlist.
6930	-an,-ard,-ary,-ed,-ing	Across the board, the American military is stretched to the breaking point.
6931	-ation,-ed,-er,-et,-ize,-ly,an-,ana-,eco-,ex-,on-,re-	Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation.
6932	-al,-ard,-ate,-ation,-en,-es,-ia,-ing,-ion,-ity,-st,-th,-tude,ad-,an-,be-,co-,for-,tri-	According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University, the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the Bush administration.
6933	-an,-er,-es,-ia,-in,-ing,-ly,-ment,-nomy,-th,an-,co-,com-,eco-,en-,for-,in-,like-,un-	If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq, and comes to involve Syria, our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously.
6934	-ed,-ial,-ic,-st,-tion,an-,dis-,eco-,im-,sub-	Add to this the economic threat posed by China, and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe.
6935	-age,-al,-an,-ant,-cide,-ed,-es,-ia,-ile,-ish,-ly,-th,an-,bar-,chemi-,deci-,en-,for-,mis-,re-,under-	If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments, missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq, our troops there will be fish in a barrel.
6936	-er,-ly,-ous,-tion,af-,an-,ov-,re-	Iran's position over the Gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair.
6937	-an,-ar,-ary,-ase,-ed,-er,-et,-ic,-ing,-le,-ling,-ome,an-,be-,co-,com-,diplo-,ent-,for-,im-,in-,new-,re-	In the worst-case scenario, the newly-minted American order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play, hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam.
6938	-ible,-ion	Conclusion: Is Any of This Possible?
6939	-ac,-er,-ial,-ible,-ic,-ly,-st,-th,-tion,an-,di-,eco-,mani-,under-	The question must be put as directly as possible: what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe?
6940	-an,-ary,-ed,-es,-fication,-ia,-ic,-ine,-ly,-or,-th,-tion,ac-,an-,co-,con-,di-,eco-,en-,im-	It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq, Iran, Syria and China simultaneously.
6941	-an,-ar,-ed,-en,-fication,-ing,-ment,-wards,be-,co-,de-,in-,to-	Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons, but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat.
6942	-ability,-an,-ar,-ation,-ed,-ent,-ergy,-ful,-ian,-in,-ing,-ly,-or,an-,be-,con-,de-,en-,end-,pre-,re-	Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation, and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor.
6943	-ar,-es,-ess,-ia,-ing,-on,an-,at-,in-,mes-,up-	Therefore, any attack upon Iran's nuclear facilities will bring Russia into the mess.

6945	-ade,-ar,-ation,-ed,-er,-et,-ly,-on,-or,an-,at-,co-,gain-,im-,off-,up-	The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation, however, seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so-called "War on Terror."

6955	-ar,-er,-es,an-,on-	The answer lies in one now-familiar name: Jack Abramoff.
6956	-al,-an,-ar,-ess,al-,an-,gain-,mid-,sub-	The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard-fought GOP gains in Congress, and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away.
6957	-ability,an-	Is any of this a probability?

7449	-ee,-ein,-es,-ise,-ly,be-,bi-,on-,pre-,re-	It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein, though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins.
7450	-er,-tion,ac-,an-,re-,to-	The lower the reins, the stronger the action and the lower the reins the stronger the action on the poll too.

7475	-ably,-ed,-er,-es,-et,-ing,-on,-ster,ad-,an-,bi-,dis-,ex-,to-,un-	took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact, if you are building up plaster ("the way you would icing") to do sculpting, which is rather uncommon, you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "mud"
7476	-es,-ster	Plaster of Paris does two things

8030	-age,-er,be-	Which rat cage is better?
8031	-age,-ant,-ed,-et,an-,wan-	Hi, I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage.
8032	-art,-er,-es,-ese,-ing,be-,co-	(Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover) Which of these two cages is better:
8035	-ant,-cide,-en,-th,be-,deci-	I cant decide between height or width.
8037	-er,-or,be-,on-	This one is better for rats.
8038	-an,-ant,-er,-or,-ways,al-,wan-	You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats.
8039	-ey	They LOVE to climb.
8040	-en,-er,-et,-id,-ing,-or,-ty,an-,co-	You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said, and make fleece covers for the stairs, so no ratty feet get caught and broken.
8041	-age,ab-,hol-	This cage will hold about 2 - 3 rats.
8042	-al,-er,-or,-th,on-	Both are equal length so go for the taller one.
8043	-age,-er,-es,-est,-th,al-,an-,be-,re-	If you use this cage it's best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like.
8044	-ade,-ed,-es,-ese,-est,-et,-ing,-ly,-or,-ry,-st,-ty,an-,on-,pre-,ter-	I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn't that great to be honest, pretty cheaply made, the door springs are annoying and it doesn't last very well.
8045	-er,-ome,be-	Here are some better options IMO:
8051	-ade,-an,-arch,-er,-es,-ese,-ing,-ive,-le,-ly,-or,-tion,ab-,al-,bi-,con-,ex-,on-	These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand...better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO.
8052	-er,-st	The First One Is much Better!
8053	-age,-er	I Have This Exact Cage, Bought From The Exact Ebay User.

8055	-er,-ide,-ing,-or,be-,cor-,un-	is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake?
8056	-age,-an,-er,-id,-ide,-ing,-on,-or,an-,re-,un-	i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side.
8057	-an,-ed,-ing,ab-,an-,be-	im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway.
8058	-ate,-ed,-er,-et,-ile,-ing,-less,-ly,-ome,-tion,an-,be-,carp-,di-,dis-,ov-,re-,sub-,to-,un-,under-	from my understanding, if its heated from the bottom, my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate, but it has better heat distribution
8059	-ad,-an,-ide,-ing,-ont,-ry,ab-,al-,an-,dis-,re-	if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up, but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well?
8060	an-	what are your suggestions and opinons?
8061	-es,-ing,al-	i use UTH's on all of my burrowing snakes.
8062	-et,-ey,-oid,al-,co-,to-	they will move if they get too warm-it's not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs.
8063	-al,-er,-ey,-ine,-ly,an-,ov-	i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine.
8064	-ad,-er,-th,an-,cor-,ov-	i have over 40 corns, kings, and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system.
8065	-ide	on the side is a waste-leave it on the bottom.
8067	-ed,-er,-ing,ab-,new-,over-	Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper...
8068	-ine,-ing,-or,an-	I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
8069	-er,an-,di-	put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner

8105	-ade,-er,-ic,-ing,-ry,en-,ever-	After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking?
8106	-ed,-es,ac-,in-	If yes, was Canada involved in this act/law?
8107	-er,-ie,-ing,-ous,-ry,-st,af-	Sorry, I'm just very nervous after watching the movie.
8108	-al,-ic,-ty,ab-,inter-,re-	SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea), which is an international maritime treaty, came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic.

8117	-al,-ed,-ent,-es,-ing,-ly,an-,en-,on-	This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed, but makes the crew proficient at launching them.

8159	-ad,-ary,-en,-er,-ing,an-,be-,in-	The screw-up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean-counters (and McNamara was nothing if not a bean-counter) instead of soldiers in charge of the military.

8648	-all,-an,-ious,-st,ag-,an-,con-,in-	If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away, do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull?

8654	-ed,-en,-er,-es,-st,-th,-wear,an-,con-,di-,un-	Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it.

8656	-ible,-ing,-ly,-one,-ont,-ry,-tion,-ty,an-,en-,in-,pre-,re-	I don't like that option though - I think it's pretty cruel and I'd not done properly you'll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake.
8657	-ane,-est,-st,-wear,an-	I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane.
8658	-art,-ed,-es,-ive,-ly,-or,-st,ab-,al-,an-,be-,bi-,co-,un-	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point, it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive.
8659	-an,-et,-ey,-ing,-ry,al-,an-,hol-,pre-	And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey.
8661	-ed,-er,-fer,-ing,-ion,-ment,-or,-st,an-	Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen/thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run.

8763	-er,-es,-ose,-scape,-st,be-	So if you lose him, he is easier to find, because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages.
8764	-ion	So my opinion is Guinea pigs.
8765	-ad,-ey,-ont	(plus they dont stink that bad)

9097	-er,an-	To answer your questions in order:
9098	-al,-ess,-ing,-or	1) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting, much less to have blood in it.
9099	-ation,-en,-er,-es,-ey,-ing,-merous,an-,be-,co-,in-,ir-	However, if they have been vomiting numerous times, then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines.
9100	-er,al-,an-,co-,fore-	He could also have Parvovirus, a GI foreign body, or any number of things.
9101	-et,-id,radio-	Did your vet take radiographs (x-rays)?
9102	-et,-ey,-ful,-scribe,di-,pre-	2) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn't think it would be helpful.
9103	-en,-er,-est,-et,inter-	3) If he shows no interest in water, then take him back to your vet.
9104	-er,an-,co-	It could be due to nausea or any number of things.
9105	-ed,-es,-ly,-ome,-rrhea,an-,be-,co-,con-,de-,dia-	He could become severly dehydrated (especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea).
9106	-ad,-an,-art,-es,-ey,-lyte,-th,an-,electro-,en-,im-	From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to heart and kidney problems.
9107	-ed,-ing,-rrhea,-st,an-,be-,de-,dia-	And being dehydrated, vomiting, and having diarrhea just doesn't feel good.
9108	-all,-et	4) Call your vet.
9109	-ed,-ency,-et,-ey,-ing,-land,-th,an-,di-,dis-,in-	They should have discussed a bland diet with you, including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting.
9110	-ation,-ed,-er,-ics,-ing,-ster,-ure,ad-,an-,anti-,be-,en-,re-	It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized, and put on IV fluids to help his hydration, administer the antibiotics IV, and to ensure that he starts to recover.
9111	-all,-arian,-ify,-ing,-ly,ab-,an-,im-	You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about.
9112	-en,-et,-ey,-st,-tion,-ware,an-,con-	They have seen your pet, and are most aware of his condition.
9113	-an,-et,-ine,-ist,-le,ab-,on-	No one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can.
9114	-ed,-ese,-et	You need to ask your vet these questions.
9115	-ed,-en,-st,an-	Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast.
9116	-land	Bland food.
9118	-en,-et,-ing,-tion,co-,to-	My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot, it could be a sign of obstruction.
9119	-ey,-id,an-	Did they do any x-rays?
9120	-ing,-ment,-on,-ont,-th,com-	I don't know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment.
9121	-al,-all,-et,an-	You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not.
9122	-ette,-ing	French dating etiquette?
9123	-ad,-ar,-ed,-ing,-ly,-ose,ab-,re-	I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this.
9124	-ance,-ing,-ly,an-	I'm in my 20's and currently studying in France.
9125	-er,-ing,-ion,-on,-ry,an-,co-	Coming from an anglo-saxon country my version of dating is 'getting the number, asking her out, etc..'
9126	-ad,-ent,-er,-et,-ette,-ing,-ly,di-,inter-,re-,to-	However, I've read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different.
9127	-en,-es,-ing,-ly,-or,par-	For them, dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties, then pairing off.
9128	-er,-es,-ing,-one,-tion,ad-,an-,com-,on-,under-	In addition, from my understanding one-on-one dates is something that comes much later and not 'straight-away' like us anglo-saxons.
9129	-ey,-ing,-ive,-ry,-ship,ab-,al-,be-,re-	They are also very secretive about being in a relationship.
9130	-ed,-en,-ey,-in,-ly,-ness,on-,re-	They only 'go out in the open' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness.
9132	-ed,-er,ac-,an-,like-,to-	I have told a French girl I liked her, and she accepted.
9133	-ee,-en,-er,-ly	She is friendly when we see each other on campus.
9134	-en,-er,-one,-th,al-	She is also nicer when we are both alone.
9135	-en,-er,-es,-ey,-le,par-	However, when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me.
9136	-ate,-er,-id,al-	She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date, to the point she said stop!
9137	-est,-ing,-st,al-,an-,inter-	My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along.
9138	-ad,-ary,-ed,-es,contra-,re-	But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary.
9139	-al,-en,-st	Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap?
9140	-ad,-ate,-es,-et,-ly,ac-,al-,co-,inter-,re-	What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios.
9141	-art,-en,-ent,-es,-ing,-le,-ly,-or,-ship,ap-,be-,com-,di-,ent-,in-,re-	You are not French for a start, so the "rules" or "customs" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds.
9142	-ar,-en,-es,-ite,mes-	From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear.
9143	-er,-est,-ing,-ly,ac-,al-,an-,dis-,en-	She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
9144	-ant,-er,-es,-ic,-ing,-ly,-st,an-,be-,off-,wan-	She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend.
9145	-ean,-ed,-er,-es,-id,-ment,-th,ac-,an-,com-,like-,wan-	You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment, but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you.
9146	-ant,-ed,-ent,-es,an-,at-,con-,par-,wan-	At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you, which is consistent.
9147	-ant,-er,-es,-ey,-ing,-or,-tion,be-,mes-,un-,wan-	Take the messages for what they are: she has no objection in you being pals at uni, but she does not want to take matters further.
9148	-ase,-ed,-er,-on,-st,an-,ap-,at-,con-	"Non!" means "non", not "I might consider it, and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case."
9149	-ane,-er,an-	Christiane gave you a good answer.
9150	-al,-en,-ing,mis-	You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding.
9151	-al,-ance,-ed,-er,-es,-ing,-ly,ad-,an-,be-,gen-,on-,un-,wan-	What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends, there's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends, which is obviously what this girl wants from you.
9152	-ably,-ant,-er,-ing,-ship,an-,com-,under-,wan-	She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level, and trying to make you understand that she doesn't want to go further.
9153	-en,-er,-ic,-ing,-le,-one,-ure,al-,be-	If she is nicer when you are alone I'd say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend.
9154	-ation,-ed,-er,-et,-ey,-ly,-th,-ware,be-,re-	You do find the 'get the number hop in bed with her' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts.
9155	-es,-ont,-or	Unfair for the girl as boys don't have that kind of handicap, but that's the way our own rules work.
9156	-arch,-one,be-,re-	Should have done research before you left.
9157	-es,-st,an-	Why not just take your chances and do it your way?
9158	-er,-ing,-ture,be-	True or false: being a young New Zealander means having no future?
9159	-ry,co-	There are no jobs in this country.
9160	-er,-ia,-ing,-ry,-st,ind-	I'm just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry.
9161	-or,-th,-ture	Is there a future for our nation's youth?
9162	-an	@Ryan B,
9163	-ate,-ee,de-,in-,under-	I'm two years into an undergraduate degree.
9164	-able,-ible,-ity,-ly,-or,ac-,in-,un-,uni-	Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available.
9165	-ee,-ia,-ry,an-,co-,over-	Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas, to Australia, etc.
9166	-es,-ly,-ment,-on,-or,em-,in-,re-	There's obviously a reason for that (lack of employment, low incomes, etc.)
9167	-er,-ing,an-,de-,re-	Your answer doesn't do anything but remind me that I'm going to be $25,000 in debt by the time I'm 22.
9170	-er,-ly,-ure,an-,re-	I really like you're answer.
9171	-al,-ry	it's very logical.
9172	-ed,-er,-ing,-or,al-,be-,con-	I've also considered becoming a teacher, but it's not a job I'm cut out for.
9173	-ed,-ish,-or,-ship,al-,ap-	I also wish I'd applied for a scholarship.
9174	-ably,-an,-ed,-er,-es,-ey,-ol,-ward,be-,di-,on-,re-	I didn't think I'd be awarded one, but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school, so my chances were probably better than I thought they were.
9175	-id,-ly,com-	Obviously I'm still completely stupid though.
9176	-art,-ean,-ly,-or,-ship,ap-,en-	I mean, I wasn't smart enough to apply for a scholarship.
9177	-es,-ic,-ing,be-	And yes, I am being melodramatic.
9178	-ol	Lol.
9179	-one	@Hatmanone,
9181	-ad,-ed,-ing,be-	Are you saying I'm bad in bed?
9183	-ing	Joking.
9184	-age,-ate,-er,-et,-ol,-ry,-wards,an-,com-,to-	Your answer is very sweet, but I'm not compassionate towards teenage high school students.
9185	-ic,-le	A little mellow dramatic?
9186	-ar,-es,-ing,-ion,-ity,-le,-less,de-,to-,uni-	In my opinion, far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees.
9187	-es,-ese,-ing,-ion,-one,-or,-th,an-,de-,inter-	Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting, but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications?
9188	-en,-er,-ing,-ly,-one,de-	I'm studying to be a teacher, so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I'm done.
9189	-able,-al,-an,-ive,-land,-st,-ty,-ure,em-,pre-	I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland, but at least I can be pretty sure I'll be employable.
9190	-an,-ee,-ent,-er,-ion,al-,an-,de-,di-	I've also got a bachelors degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession.
9191	-an,-et,-ia,-id,-ont,al-	I also know that you don't get paid that much more in Australia than you do here.
9192	-er,-es,-ia,-ing,-st,ab-,al-,co-	And it's not all about how much you earn, cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia.
9193	-al,-ary,-en,-ey,-ing,-ry,com-	Try living in Sydney on a teacher's salary, then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago.
9194	-ia,-ing,-th,ac-,al-,an-	You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia.
9195	-ably,-an,-ent,-ing,-ise,-ive,an-	It's probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan.
9196	-ably,-es,-est,-ment,inter-	At the moment there's no interest, but that'll probably change.
9197	-ably,-ed,-est,ad-,al-,inter-	And they'll probably add interest to what you've already racked up.
9198	-ing,-ite,-le,-oid,-ry,-wards,ab-,be-,co-,extra-,to-	And they're working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back.
9199	-an,-land,-ly,-ment,-ome,-or,be-,co-,com-,for-,on-,over-	At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they'll force you cough up.
9200	-est,-ing,-ure,al-,inter-,over-	And all that time you're overseas you'll be racking up interest.
9201	-ing,-tion,re-	I wouldn't like not having the option to return to NZ.
9202	-ate,-ed,-ee,-es,-ess,-id,-ly,-ship,ab-,co-,de-,ex-,for-,re-	I guess I'm extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree.
9203	-ard,-ed,-ing,an-	But I worked hard and I'm still working hard.
9204	-all,-an,-ar,-ey,-le,to-	There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap.
9206	-ation,-et	Get an education!
9207	-ine,-ing	I'm doing fine.
9208	-er,-in,-ont,-st,-th,be-	Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground, don't assume it's better in Oz.
9209	-ad,-ane,-en,-er,-ing,-le,-ly,-or,-ry,-st,an-,be-,co-	People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20+ years, so it's not anything new.
9210	-er,-or,de-	It depends on what you hunger for.
9211	-ed,-ent,ad-	700f jobs aren't advertised.
9212	-ing	That means making yourself known; that means networking.

9225	-ont	i don't know why he won't eat though!
9226	-ed,-en,-es,-ing,-ive,an-,tri-	i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen (thawed) pinkies.
9227	-an,-ed,-er,-ing,bi-,tri-	i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is.
9228	-all,-ed,-er,-ing,-ont,-or,an-,con-,to-,tri-	i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won't touch the pinky.
9229	-es,-ry,to-	he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them.

9231	-ad,-ed,-es,-et,-ing,-ive,-th,-tion,an-,at-,de-,tri-	i have tried "braining" both live and dead pinkies, and bloodying them up to get his attention, but he doesn't care.

9233	-ed,-es,-ile,-ing,-ome,-ont,an-,hol-,re-,tri-	i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake's face.

9240	-ed,-en,-es	When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him?
9241	-ed,-ry,-st,co-,to-	If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry.
9242	-ed,-es,-ry,-st,al-,inter-	If he doesn't seem interested in them at all I would say he's just not hungry.
9243	-en,-es,-ie,-ry,an-,at-,on-	My boyfriend has one and when she's hungry she attacks the pinkie right away.
9244	-an,-ant,-ey,-ont,-st,-ure,an-,wan-	They can smell it so i'm sure he knows what it is and just don't want it.
9245	-an,-er,-es,-ile,-ing,with-	Remember snakes can go awhile without eating.
9246	-ate,-ation,-ed,-er,-ey,-ism,-ity,-like,-ly,ac-,an-,de-,ent-,meta-,re-,under-	In the winter, they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation-like state called brumation, which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity.
9247	-ar,-art,-er,-es,-ing,-ly,co-,par-	King snakes sometimes stop eating, particularly during the cooler part of the year.
9248	-al,-ate,-ey,in-	They have a natural instinct to hibernate.
9249	-ably,-ant,-ation,-ing,-ite,-ly,-ped,-ure,an-,ap-,be-,en-,equi-,pre-	If the snake is not pregnant or shedding, and its enclosure is properly equipped, a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation.
9250	-al,-ation,-ed,-es,-ing,-ity,-or,an-	Hibernation is natural, and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred.
9251	-an,-er,-ing	Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding.

9253	-ing,to-	Its body will be dull looking, too.

9255	-all,-er,-es,-ing,-le,-ly,-mer,-ome,-or,-th,an-,exa-	For example, some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter, feeding mainly in spring and fall.

9312	-ad,-ar,-arch,-ed,-ency,-ing,-land,-th,ad-,an-,in-,pre-	This left Westmoreland with few options, so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is, in the long run, the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency.
9313	-ed,-ing	Thing is, it worked.
9314	-al,-ed,-ese,-ey,-in,-ing,-ment,-ry,-th,an-,be-,bi-,in-	The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC (the guerilla movement), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC (which was light infantry) and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).

9321	-an,-ar,-ed,-er,-et,-ey,-ful,-ing,-ive,-ped,-st,an-,at-,de-,ur-	However, what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations.

9330	-ate,-en,-ey,-ive	When give the ultimate choice, they rallied…

9335	-ad,-ary,-ed,-es,-ia,-ish,-ist,-or,-ory,allo-,an-,com-,for-,in-	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces.

9346	-ade,-ar,-er,-es,-et,-ey,-fer,-ing,-ling,-ly,-th,an-,be-,co-,con-,ov-,pre-	Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight.

9349	-ed,-gon,-tion	Bearded dragon question...?
9350	-st,on-	I just bought a baby one yesterday.
9351	-al,-ant,-es,-ial,-ing,-le,-or,an-,be-,im-,psycho-,re-,well-	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35% more light/heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well-being of him.
9352	-ean,-es,-ly,-tion,on-	My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat, but the "sun rays" he needs?
9353	-ing,al-	I also was wondering how long should this light be on.
9354	-art,-es,-et,-id	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours, but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours.
9355	-ed,-es,-et,-in,-ing,-ome	He's getting used to his new home, but hasn't eatin yet.
9356	-ed,-gon,-ile,an-,be-	I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze- dried crickets.
9357	-ed,-ly,ad-,ap-	Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
9358	-or	Thank you for your time.
9359	-al,-an,-ed,-es,-et,-gon,-ing,-ive,-ly,-ry,ac-,an-,be-,di-,re-	Let me try to break this down as simply as I can: diurnal (active during the day time) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "light," UVA, UVB, and heat.
9360	-ide,-ing,-ite,-or,em-,in-,on-	Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA, including heat bulbs, that's the easy one to provide for.
9361	-an,-ed,-er,-escent,-ly,fluor-,on-,re-	UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source.
9362	-ate,-ile,-less,-ly,-or,-ry,-th,-ways,al-,an-,em-,on-,re-,un-	UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp, unless you use a MVB (mercury vapor bulb) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb.
9363	-age,-er,-es,-ey,-ing,-le,-ly,-ness,-or,-tion,and-,co-,out-,ov-,re-	I highly recommend that you do not use coiled/compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and/or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time.
9364	-ation,-en,-er,-est,-ible,-ing,ac-,af-,be-,re-	The long tube UVB bulbs are best, like Zoomed's Repsitun model: http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturers recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is.
9365	-ed,-en,-er,-es,-st,-tion,an-,be-	So, to answer your question, no, if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "the sun's rays" that your bearded needs.
9366	-ed,-ide,-ing,al-	You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting.
9367	-able,-art,-es,-ess,-est,-et,-ey,-ing,-on,-ont,-ry,-st,-ways,al-,be-,em-,in-,re-	The person at Petsmart is very wrong; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you; they don't have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info.
9368	-able,-ing,-or,ab-,ad-,an-	UVB and basking temp (should be about 110 F for a baby, 95 F for an adult) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day.
9369	-ed,-er,-fer,-ive,-le,in-,off-	Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source; you need to offer live feeder insects.
9370	-ed,-ee,-en,-er,-es,-ey,-ing,-ly,re-,tri-	Bearded dragons are sight hunters, they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response, especially when they are babies.
9371	-al,-an,-ed,-er,-ive,al-	Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried.
9372	-an,-ed,-er,-es,-fer,-ia,-ious,-ix,-le,-ster,an-,be-,exa-,in-,off-,re-	Crickets, silk worms, phoenix worms, and various feeder roaches, like red-lobster, turkistan, and dubia, are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded.
9373	-al,-ed,-ly,-or,an-,off-,on-	Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items, for variety's sake.
9374	-able,-ad,-ed,-es,-et,-ing,-ly,-ome,-ure,be-,cor-,ever-,re-	I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly:
9377	-age,-ar,-ed,-er,-ize,-st,con-,de-,in-	mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in..atleast as far as i'm concerned.
9378	-all,-an,-ant,-en,-ide,-ite,-le,-ly,-or,-scape,-st,-th,an-,exa-,ful-,on-,twi-	if there are shady areas he can move to (for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side) then you can leave it on a full 12-14 hours, if its a small tank and he can't escape the light then 4-6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4-6 hours at a time twice a day.
9379	-an,-ation,-ed,-en,-ence,-er,-ing,-ish,-ly,-ome,-ry,-ture,al-,an-,be-,ex-,ov-,with-	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven.
9380	-ant,-es,-or,-th,im-	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays..which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans.
9381	-art,-es,-est,dis-,re-	That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates... sheesh.
9382	-ary,-es	Yes, it gives him the "sun rays" necessary, that's what UVA is.
9383	-al,-ment,-or,-st,en-	And it should be on 10-12 hours, just like the sun would be up for 10-12 hours in his natural environment.
9384	-meter,-or,-st,-ure,thermo-	As for the heat, just be sure to use a thermometer.
9385	-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ess,-ing,an-,to-	Also, Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving, so its anyone's guess whether or not he'll touch the freeze-dried crickets or the processed food.
9386	-an,-ey,-ont,-ry,al-,co-	I tell all my customers they can try it, but don't count on it.
9387	-en,-es,-fy,-le,-ry,an-	Also try green leafy veggies, like kale and spinach.

9419	-ad,-es,-or,an-,be-,bi-	Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird.

9491	-an,-en,-er,-es,-ing,-th,an-,col-	The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you, clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up.

9670	-ad,-ar,-ase,-er,-ey,-ing,-ly,-or,be-,ex-	Ok, well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case, they are extremely well known farriers in the area.
9671	-ed,-ing,be-,con-,mis-,on-	I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail.
9672	-ant,-es,-et,-ible,-id,-on,-th,be-,di-,re-,wan-	The reason he said he didn't put that nail in was because he "didn't want to risk it" with my horse's horrible feet.
9673	-ed,-es,-et,-one,-st,-th,ab-,be-	This is about the fourth time they've done my horse's feet because I just switched back to them.
9674	-ed,-ing,-ly,-on,-st,-th,ap-,be-,on-,re-	The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own.
9675	-all,-er,-or,with-	However, he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS(now that's what I call a crap farrier).
9676	-ling,-th,ad-	Which, I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails.
9677	-ed,-ese,-ly	So, obviously I switched back to these guys.
9678	-er,-es,-ol,-ome,-ped,an-	Ok, calm down, it's not like he's some stranger that came up and groped me lol.
9679	-or,ab-	I've known the guy for about 10 years.
9680	-en,-er,-th	I am 21, so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other!
9681	-an,-er	He is a few years older than me.
9682	-es	And yes, I do like him.
9683	-er,-es,-id,-ing,-ite,-or,-ry,al-,an-,di-	To answer Barry White, yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he's waiting for.
9684	-all,-an,-en,-er,-ey,-ly,-ome,-ry,-st,an-,co-,com-	On the other hand, he could very easily just call me and say hey I'm busy right now, I'll call you when I can come out.
9685	-ar,-ed	And as far as scheduled visits go, I have no idea.
9686	-er,-one,be-	I've never done that before though either.
9687	-all,-ed,-er,-et,-one,-st,-ways,al-,be-	It's always just "Okay, they're feet need to be done, better call the farrier."
9688	-ey,-in,-ly,-ome,com-,with-	And they usually come out within a few days.
9689	-all,-ure	He will call you back Im sure!
9690	-es,-ly,like-,re-	Sounds like He really likes you..
9691	-ed	But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way?
9692	-ee,-ing,-or,-th,co-	would You like going for *coffee* with him?
9694	-ed,un-	Or are you undecided?
9696	-all,-ard,-es,-et,-in,-ing,ag-,co-	I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get?
9697	-ee,-ey,-ing,-ome,an-,com-,ex-	I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming..
9698	-er,-ing,-ly,-ont,-th,be-,mis-,on-,re-	Edit... I really dont think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing..
9699	-ad,-en,-es,-ine,-ing,-one,-ose,-st,-th	I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to...
9700	-ed,-ee,-er,-es,-et,-in,-ive,-ly,-tion,ad-,ag-,an-,be-,con-,re-	I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
9701	-ad,-age,-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ie,-ing,-ly,-ont,-or,-ose,-st,ab-,ever-,re-	When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby..( for those who don't Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page) dumb as a post about everything But horses..
9702	-ad,-ance,-ate,-ed,-er,-ly,-th,an-,di-,on-,to-	He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids.. but we both flirted Horribly with each other.. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date. :(
9703	-en,-er,be-	sorta wonder what it would have been like?
9704	ag-	But That was Years ago.
9705	-ad,-ing,-ling	He had this Habit of telling you Everything..

9712	-ed,-en,-or,re-	I was heartbroken.. but then realized He was not the Guy for me..
9713	-ably,-age,-all,-an,-ed,-er,-es,-ey,-ing,-ive,-ly,-or,-ry,an-,inter-,mes-,re-	Wow he does sound interested in you, my farrier never gives me hugs like that (probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids) anyway, I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don’t leave a message so you don’t have to necessarily wait for him to call.
9714	-ator,-es,-ing,-ly,-ness,-ty,an-,re-	From the point of view of a business, and client/operator relationships, he's doing a really shitty job.
9715	-all,-er,-ing,-ome,an-,com-	Leaving nails out so you'll call and have him come back out later?
9716	-all,-ar,-ent,-er,-es,-est,-ing,-ity,-st,be-,di-,sub-	Cute or not, I'd call a different bloke because he's doing a sub-par job at something he needs to be doing his best at, whether he's flirting or trying to ask you out or not, he ought to put quality first.
9717	-er,-in,-ing,-mer,-ness,-th,af-,al-,an-,re-,wan-	This is, after all, his business, and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work?
9718	-one,-th	EPM, Anyone Dealt with it?
9719	-ent,-ing,di-	Might be something different?
9720	-ar,-ee,-er,-ick,-ity,-or	I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free.
9721	-en,-es,-ing,be-,is-	He's not lame, but he's been having issues.
9722	-er,-es,-id	Here's what the owner has said:
9723	-ar,-ide,-le,-st,ab-,ag-,al-,mon-	I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3-4 months ago.
9724	-ad,-age,-ed,-er,-et,-eth,-ible,-ine,-le,an-,be-	I chalked it up to possible nerve damage, because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems.
9725	-ed,-ent,-er,-st,bar-	So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels.
9726	-ad,-ed,-ome,-st,-th,an-,at-,ever-,ex-,mon-	I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday (I expected him to drop some).
9727	-ide,-ing,-le,an-	He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day.
9728	-ad,-eth,-ist,an-,de-	Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems.
9729	-an,-ed,-le,al-,an-	He can eat all his feed and doesn't drop any, but cannot eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it.
9730	-ant,-ine,-ing,-le,an-,to-	He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle.
9731	-ad,-es,-le,-logical,-ly,-th,an-,bar-,on-,to-	The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead.
9732	-ad,-ed,-es,-le,-or,-st,-th,ab-,ag-,at-,co-,post-,re-	The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life.
9733	-er,-th,af-	I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him.
9734	-al,-est,-et,-id,-ive,-logical,-one,an-,di-,ex-,exa-,physi-	NO, I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam.
9735	-ed,-est,-logical,be-	We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs.
9736	-an,-er,-ing,-le,-ome,-trophy,an-,at-	He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss, and some muscle atrophy.
9737	-ed,-es,-et,-ile,-in,-le,-st,al-,be-	He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws.
9738	-an,-ee,-et,an-	So I might get the horse and see what I can do.
9739	-al,-er,-est,-et,-id,-ing,-one,-or,-st,-th,an-	I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him, have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test.
9740	-an,-er,-ing,al-,co-,re-	Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well.
9741	-er,-ory	My other theory would be wobblers.
9742	-et,-ine,-ing,-ist,-ome,chiro-,equi-	I'll be having my equine chiro/acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him....
9743	an-	So any ideas?
9746	-al,-ate,an-	Horse is out of state and not local.
9747	-er,-et,-ling,-th	Owner is willing to meet me half way with him.
9748	-et,-ling,ab-,an-	I will be calling my vet and chiro about him.
9749	-es,-ment,-ture,-ty,an-,com-,pre-	Worse comes to worse, I'm out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament.
9750	-able,-er,-es,-ing,-le,-ly,an-,is-,un-	He's still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle.
9751	-ad,-ase,-en,-le,-ment,-ome,-wise,ab-,af-,an-,com-,other-	This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn't be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price.
9752	-ed,-er,-graph,-id,-ify,para-,post-	I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3, that is not me to clarify.
9753	-ant,-ase,-er,-ing,-ly,-or,af-,an-,full-,on-,re-	She is the one that can't afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn't recover fully.
9754	-ad,-an,-ant,-ed,-en,-in,-or,-ular,al-,an-,re-	He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can't eat regular hay.
9755	-an,-ard,-in,-ont	I don't think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain.
9756	-ant,-ick,-ing,af-	I am not going to go pick up a horse I can't afford.
9757	-est,-ling,an-	I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat.
9758	-able,-er,on-,un-	The owner is the one who is unable.
9759	-ate,-er,-et,-ing,-ist,-or,ac-,al-	I will also be having my other vet up who's a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers.
9760	-age,-ed,-en,-er,-et,-ible,-ing,-ly,-ome,-ry,-st,-th,-ture,an-,ex-,in-,sym-	July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury.
9761	-ad,-ed,-es,-le,-ly,-ome,-th,-trophy,an-,at-,bi-,co-,ex-,on-,re-,to-	He's only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy, with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead (which could or couldn't be related).
9762	-in	The horse is not in pain.
9763	-es,-ing	He's not starving.
9764	-es,-ing	He's dropping we
9765	-in	The horse is not in pain.
9766	-es,-ing	He's not starving.
9767	-ard,-en,-es,-ing,-or,-st,an-,be-	He's dropping weight, but most of that came from being at the trainers and being ridden hard for 60 days.
9768	-es,-ing	He's not putting it back on.
9769	-ibility,-ing,an-	I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down.
9770	-ad,-er,-es,-le,-ly,-ome,af-,com-	At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM.
9771	-ing,-ive,ex-	I know this is going to be expensive.
9772	-ive,-ling	I'm willing to give it a shot.
9773	-ad,-arch,-en,-es,-ing,-ite,-ole,al-,an-,be-,col-,re-	Gallop, I've already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well.
9774	-ed,-es,-ment,an-	Looked at studies, treatment options and such.
9775	-est,-ing,-one,be-	I will have the EPM test done before treating.
9776	-al,-an,-ate,-ed,-en,-ion,-ist,-or,-th,an-,chiro-,com-,con-	The chiro/acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM.
9777	-ase,-en,-ing,-ture,ac-,is-	If that is the case then acupuncture isn't going to hurt him.
9778	-ative,-es,-ly,-or,ac-,al-,on-	It's actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
9779	-cide,-ed,-en,-es,-ible,-ing,-ly,an-,be-,deci-,in-,re-	I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals (and a bunch of Yahoos) before you decide to take this horse on.
9780	-al,-ant,-ed,-ing,-ion,-ment,-ome,ab-,an-,com-,re-	I do think some Y!A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can't comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse.
9781	-all,-ase,-er,-ing,-st,af-,an-	Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down.
9782	-ing,-or	Is that something you are up for?
9783	-al,-an,-ive,-or,-ure,al-,an-	If so go for it and I'll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up.
9784	-en,-es,-ing,-ome,-ry,-th,an-	It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down, but some horses are worth the risk.
9785	-an,-en,-et,-th,-ure	If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out.
9786	-ad,-al,-ee,-id,-ing,-th,be-,de-	As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we've had to deal with it.
9787	-able,-ry,-ty,ever-	Pretty much every large stable has here.
9788	-al,-ed,-en,-ive,-ly,-ment,-st,ad-,an-,dia-,ex-,on-	Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada.
9789	-ed,-or,an-	We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there.
9790	-ed,-ence,-ing,an-,di-,re-	That horse returned to racing and we didn't notice much difference.
9791	-ad,-an,-en,-es,-ing,-one,be-,non-	We've had a few since then, but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida.
9792	-ad,-ed,-ent,-er,-ey,-ing,-st,be-,re-	I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers, but we haven't had an EPM horse in at least 10 years.
9793	-an,-ed,-ee,-en,-es,-ey,-ing,-ly,al-,an-,re-	I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing.
9794	-ed,-en,-er,-ing,-or,af-,be-	One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM.
9795	-ed,-en,-er,-ile,-ways,al-,be-,bi-,like-	We've always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1/2 mile.
9796	-ed,-ence,-er,-es,-ly,af-,di-,on-	The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after.
9797	-ation,-ence,-er,-es,-et,-ine,-ly,-ose,-st,-th,bi-,co-,ex-	It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns.
9798	-ont	I don't know.
9799	-es,-on,be-,com-	MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here.
9800	-an,-ant,-ee,-et,-th,an-,to-,wan-	You may want to see if you can get in touch with their EPM group and get this guy in a study.
9801	-ed,-ent,-ey,-id,-ing,-ly,co-,di-,pre-	I know they did lab work showing that Strongid C used daily could help prevent EPM.
9802	-al,-ed,-ey,-ing,-ose,be-,re-	I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now, but it may be sometime before those results are released.
9803	-er,-est,-ile,-ing,-on,-th,be-,co-	Another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile?
9804	-an,-er,-est,-ile,-ways,al-,an-,in-,sym-	West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and doesn't always include a fever.
9805	-cide,-et,deci-	Let us know what you decide to do.
9806	-ate,-ed,-ee,-ent,-es,-ese,-et,-ly,-ont,co-,is-	You hate to see talent get wasted, but honestly I don't think I could take in a horse right now these issues.
9807	-ing,-ly,-st	Personally I think you should just keep on walking by.
9808	-ant,-cide,be-,deci-,wan-	You should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not.
9809	-able,-ant,-ee,-est,-ey,-ly,-th,-ure,an-,de-,re-,wan-	If you have a good repoire (which I'm sure you do) with them, they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree... not really sure what you want to do with him...
9810	-al,-an,-ance,-en,-in,-ion,-or,-th,-ture,-ure,-ways,ag-,al-,an-,de-,re-	Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh, there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future.
9811	-ey,-ing,-ont,al-,be-,mon-	So all in all, put the money up front before taking on this horse.
9812	-ed,-et,-ly,on-	A few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name.
9813	-ad,-ing,-trophy,at-	Could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy?
9814	-th,bi-,di-	Or a difficult birth?
9815	-ways,al-	Was it always like this?
9816	-ed,-th,bi-	Or has it occurred since birth.
9817	-ad,-er,al-	I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke?
9818	-ed,-er,-et,af-,con-	I think if you cannot afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect.
9819	-ive,-ture,an-,ex-,hol-	Who knows what the future might hold, and it might be expensive?
9820	-ad,-ly,-mer	Extremely bad customer service
9821	-ed,-et,-ly,-on	Do not go to this salon, especially if you have to get your hair straightened.
9822	-ad,-en,-ent,-ey,-id,-ly,-or,-ry,-th,an-,di-,ex-	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn't work for my hair.
9823	-eous,-ive,-le,dis-,in-	Rude, insensitive, discourteous people!!!!!
9825	-ard,-ed,-ive,-or,-ry,-ular,an-,in-,re-	Dr Greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor.
9826	-able,-al,-ed,-er,-in,-scribe,di-,pre-,re-,un-	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs, he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable.

11820	-ant,-ed,-er,-ey,-ile,an-,be-,di-,wan-	I feel like they didn't tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price?
11821	-er,-ese,-ey,-ing,-le,-ont,ab-,an-,re-	Either these people don't know anything about what they are renting, or worse- they are bait and switching.
11822	-er,-or,-ry,ano-,re-	One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry.

11828	-an,-art,-ed,-er,-et,-ine,-ly,-one,-ry,-tion,an-	Whereas my answer to the question "Where do you get your laundry done?" used to be, "At the checkout line at WalMart," I can honestly say the answer now is, "At The Laundry Tub."

11844	-ad,-ed,-ee,-en,-er,-es,-ey,-in,-ing,-le,-ly,-th,an-,bar-,be-,de-,im-,on-,re-	However, the bartenders/waitresses definately need to be re-trained (if they ever had any to begin with) and learn two things: only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting.
11845	-er,-es,-ing,-ome,-st,be-,re-,under-	In some cases the result is because of understaffing, in some cases the staff just doesn't care/know better.
11846	-en,-est,-et,-ey,-ing,-ome,-st,-ture,al-,be-	They must also get something to keep take-out warm, so it's not room temperature at best when you get it home.

11860	-an,-cy,-ed,-et,-le,-ly,an-,re-,tri-	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll, spicy crab and tuna roll, and sweet potato tempura roll ($15, $10, and $3.75 respectively).
11861	-arian,-ed,-er,-et,-ing,-ious,-ise,-ly,-th,ac-,an-,de-,on-,tri-	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise: cheap and delicious, the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value (and I never get vegetarian rolls).
11862	-en,-ent,-er,-ial,-ing,-ly,al-	The other rolls weren't at all special, especially given their pricing.
11863	-ed,-ine,-ly,an-,is-,re-	The bottom line is that the food isn't great and is relatively high-priced.

11875	-ad,-al,-ed,-ly,ad-,al-,bi-,de-,on-	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded, so only 4 guests were effected (no big deal to him).
11876	-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ive,-le,-or,an-,apo-,off-,pre-,re-,un-	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever, and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times.

12264	-ed,-ey,-st,al-,an-,to-	He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks.

12266	-er,-or,-st,-ty,-ure,pre-	I'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around.

12271	-en,-ence,-id,-ing,-st,-th,di-,ex-	Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA, so I did not know what to expect.

12275	-ad,-arch,-ary,-ed,-ing,-ly,-ment,-ome,-ure,an-,on-,re-,to-	Asked why, Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment (it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary, one would think) and that took time to figure out.
12276	on-	Well, that was strike one.
12277	-in,-ing,ag-	I wasn't going to use them again, but I was going to leave it at that.
12278	-er,-ing,-ion,-ite,-ize,-ly,-ome,com-,de-,exa-,re-,to-	However, now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $6,000+ despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do, I feel I have to voice my opinion.

12282	-ad,-ed,-en,-ese,-et,-ty	I may not have to pay a penalty, yet, but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys.

12293	-able,-ad,-ed,-er,-ing,-on,ab-,al-,an-,com-,di-	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in.

12297	-ed	I waited.

12299	-ed,-er,con-,on-	He never once contacted us.

12302	-able,-en,-ont,ad-,an-,be-	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don't have my table (which was NOT cheap, I might add).
12303	-al,-ative,-ed,-es,-et,-id,-ing,-le,-ome,-ry,-ture,ab-,an-,com-,de-,di-,for-,re-	Point is: You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong, you'll have to fight to get it resolved.

12375	-art,-en,-ent,-er,-id,-ing,-on,-one,-or,-st,com-	Even my PA i went to the other day said "it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you".
12376	-id,-ly	He said it sarcastically.
12377	-ant,-ate,-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ey,-ie,-ing,-or,ab-,an-,on-,re-,wan-	If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind, and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need, when they will not work for you, go to this doctor...he is the one for you.
12378	-ad,-an,-ence,be-,ex-	What you can learn from the below 'bad experience'.
12379	-ad,-ed,-ence,-est,-ing,-ome,ex-,re-	I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the 'bad experience' review.
12380	-ably,-ard,-ed,-ey,-ing,-ont,-ry,-st,com-,ever-,in-	I'd probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here, seeing that they don't just take every dog coming in.
12381	-ean,-ed,-or,al-,an-,im-,to-	I've toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was, and all the options for the dogs.
12382	-ate,-ed,-en,-ity,be-,un-	It's unfortunate that bmil believed that his 'perfect' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself.
12383	-an,-ee,-en,-er,-et,-ey,-istic,-one,-ont,an-,ano-,ex-,in-,un-	But I've done hundreds of dog introductions myself (another place, I don't work here), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs.
12384	-ee,-ese,-ey,-le,-ling,-ly,-tion,ab-,an-,in-,inter-	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively; and it's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem.
12385	-ad,-ey,-ful,-ial,-ing,-ment,-ose,-st,ac-,an-	It sounds (according to your own statement) that they had a roomful of dogs, so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems.
12386	-ed,-ergy,-le,-or,-st,-th,an-,en-	You say you work a lot, and that you have a young dog; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him.
12387	-er,-es	But not at a risk to other people's pets.
12388	-ance,-ard,-ative,-ed,-en,-er,-es,-et,-ing,-le,-ly,-ome,al-,an-,ano-,at-,co-,com-,in-	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home, to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times, getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later.
12389	-able,-ey,-ing,-ness,-on,is-,re-,with-	No business is going to push customers away without good reason; so isn't it reasonable to think they might know what they're doing?
12390	-ar,-le,-ly,-or,-st,an-,be-,in-,on-	My dogs are far from perfect, and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself (at least initially).
12391	-able,-al,-ant,-ard,-ed,-ey,-ing,-le,-ont,-st,-th,an-,at-,be-,ex-,re-,wan-	Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this; and maybe don't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don't want to work hard, just because you bruised your own ego.
12392	-er,-est	Dumbest F'ers ever
12393	-ed,-er,-et,-ing,-one,an-,fore-,hol-,to-,twi-,with-	I called dominos tonight, it rang forever, I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says, MAY I HELP YOU?

12395	-all,-ey,-ick	They say no, Warwick in New Jersey, Call New Jersey.
12396	-ick,an-	I laugh and say, no, that Warwick is in New York, but I'm at the Radison-Warwick.
12397	-ia,-ick,-ure	And he says: You're at Warwick in Pennsylvania?
12398	-ar,-ick,-id,-on,-ry,-ship,-ure,an-,to-	and I said, YES, CENTER CITY PHILLY, and he says, NO, Warwick is a township, If you're at a Radison in Warwick thats too far, try dominos in Pottstown.

12401	-all,to-	Call dominos in your town.
12402	-er,-th,an-,de-	I SAY LISTEN: I'm at 17th and LOCUST, do you deliver there?
12403	exa-	He says, I have to have an exact ADDRESS.

12407	-th,-ure	YES I am sure, well, she says, is that ON 17th STREET.

12413	-ad,-est	YES, I am west of broad.
12414	-ad,-est,-et,-th,an-,on-	Broad, I say, is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut.
12415	-ad,-en,-ling,-ont,-st	Hmmm, she says, Then why are you calling here, we don't go past broad?
12416	-ed,-ent,-er,-ing,-ling,af-,an-	Anyway, after much yelling and cussing I hung up, grabbed a cab, and went to Geno's.
12417	-ey,-ick,-ix,mon-	Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem!
12418	-ive,-ly,-ry	B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June.
12419	-ation,-ence,-er,-ey,-in,-ling,-lite,-or,-ry,an-,be-,in-,re-	They were very polite, eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence.
12420	-ad,-ar,-ed,-ence,-ey,-ing,-ly,-or,-ship,-st,an-,in-,mon-	Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "Workmanship is guaranteed for a year!".
12421	-ad,-ate,-ed,-in,-ing,-one,on-	Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in.
12422	-all,-ative,-ed,-en,an-,off-,re-	We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of.
12423	-ard,-ing	We heard nothing.
12424	-an,-ard,-ed,-en,-ent,-id,-ing,-ise,-one,an-,co-,off-	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he'd send someone out to look at it but couldn't promise when- two weeks came and went and we heard nothing.
12425	-ar,-art,-ed,-in,-ion,-or,-ship,-st,ag-,an-,par-,to-	I just called again and was told that workmanship, not wood, is guaranteed for a year- well in my opinion- the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship!
12426	-ar,-ard,-en,-ent,-ling,ab-,on-	She even went so far as to say "Your calling about one board?"
12427	-ant,-en,-er,-ing,-or,an-,hol-,ov-,wan-	Well- when you pay over $1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good!!!
12429	-ard,-ling,ab-,on-	I WAS calling about one board!!
12430	-ant,-ar,-ard,-ed,-er,-es,-et,-ey,-ick,-in,-mer,-ome,-or,-ry,-th,al-,an-,be-,com-,de-,dis-,en-,on-,re-,wan-	I'm very frustrated at this point- it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked (the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer.
12431	-an,-ant,-ed,-en,-ence,-et,-ey,-ix,-one,-ont,-ure,ab-,ever-,in-,mon-,on-,wan-	So I figure if they don't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money!!!
12434	-er,-es,-ey,an-,un-	They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why!!!
12435	-ar,-ed,-en,-ence,-ey,-ion,-ive,-ix,-mer,-ness,-or,-ped,-st,an-,in-,on-,un-	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars, now for their poor customer follow-up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one-star in my opinion!
12436	-er,-es,-st,-th,in-	Lots of rules, phantom innkeeper, last minute price was worth it.
12437	-ed,-er,-es,-ing,an-,be-,re-	I called the "207" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up.
12438	-ed,-en,-er,-es,-st,ab-,an-,in-	I then called the 800 number (which was answered) and inquired about last minute rates.
12439	-ad,-ate,-ed,-ey,-th	They had a room with a $99 rate, which I booked.
12440	-ed,-ey,-or	The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor, but they put us on the 3rd.
12441	-ad,-an,-ar,-ation,-ed,-es,-ing,ab-,con-,dec-,em-,in-,re-,sui-	The email confirmation (which I read in the car) warned about large suitcases, declaring that we are innkeepers, not longshoreman.
12442	-er,-es,-ey,-ise,-th,sui-,to-	In other words, they do not help with suitcases, but they promise totes to help.
12443	-al,-en,-er,-on,in-,on-,up-	However upon our arrival no one there (the inn was open).
12444	-es,to-	So no totes.
12445	-ad,-ed,-er,-id,-ly,ac-,an-,co-,cor-,ex-,to-,un-	Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M, no exceptions.
12446	-en,-one	Then she was gone.
12447	-ed,-er,-th,af-,an-,di-,in-,on-,re-	We returned after 3PM, found no one there, and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room.
12448	-an,-es,-ing,-st	Rules in the room: #1) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash.
12449	-an,-en,-er,-ey,-ome,-th	If they think you've taken a soda from your room home with you, they will charge you $1.50 per can.
12450	-ey,-ure,co-	They count the cans in the trash to make sure.
12451	-er,-ey,-ome	#2) If you take the shampoo products home, they will charge you $8 per item.
12452	-ant,-ate,-er,-ey,-or,-st,af-,an-,ful-,wan-	#) If you want a late checkout, (after 11 AM) they charge you $15 for the first hour, $25 for the second hour, and after 2PM it's a full day charge.
12453	-st	#4) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM.
12454	-er,an-	No earlier and no later.
12455	-ed,-er,al-	If you go later, it's all cleaned up.
12456	-ont	(By whom, I don't know.
12457	-er,-one,an-	I never saw anyone there.
12458	-ed,-es,-ese,post-	All these rules are posted in the rooms.)
12459	-ad,-al,-ed,-ee,-ine,-ist,-or,an-,co-,di-,ex-,ind-,uni-	Snacks: uninspired bread, tea backs, and individual coffee things for a machine that didn't exist.
12460	-ed,-ee,-er,-ing,-or,an-,co-	I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee.
12461	-es,-ine	No wine glasses.
12462	-ad,-ean,-ed,com-,di-	Room was clean, but had a weird, dated, sink/stove combo that didn't work.
12463	-ad,-all,-ean,-er,-th,ex-	Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems.
12465	-al,-ed,-er,-ly,-th,on-,to-	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads, but only one worked.
12466	-et,-ont	Don't get the rooms off the two kitchens.
12467	-ar,-en,-ey,-ing,ever-	They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything.
12468	-ee,-ing,par-	Free parking.
12469	-ate,-et,-in,-st,ag-,co-	I'd go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $99, but I wouldn't pay their rack rate.
12470	-th,over-	Quit with the overstatements!
12471	-an,-ant,-en,-ic,-ing,-ite,-le,-one,-or,-st,an-,dec-,ever-,hyper-,re-,to-	The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "everyone" is going to "love" the food, decor and service.
12472	-ant,-ence,-ine,-ing,-le,-ome,-th,an-,di-,ex-,par-,re-,uni-	The truth is, in my and my dining partners' experience, this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food.
12473	-ence,-er,-ly,an-,ent-,ex-	It's an entirely up and down experience, however.
12474	-al,-es,-est,-ing,-ry,be-,com-,uni-	Now, the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal.
12475	-ed,-en,-ent,-er,-es,-est,-ey,-ly,-ont,-st,con-,ex-,like-	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I've ever seen placed in front of me (you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't explained to you).
12476	-ent,-et,-ey,-ly,-ont,en-,ex-,for-,gen-,re-	Though they are mostly excellent, you generally don't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them.
12477	-id,-ing,an-,be-	That being said, the laffa and hummus are out of this world.
12478	-ad,-ed,-ee,-en,-ent,-er,-es,-id,-in,-ing,-on,-or,-ose,ag-,an-,di-,re-,to-	Then again, for the three of us who dined together, two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more, and licking the hummus from our fingers (and yes, those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three-person order).
12479	-ence,-er,al-,ex-,up-	Dinner was also an up-and-down experience.
12480	-arian,-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ile,-most,-on,-or,-ry,-ways,al-,an-,and-,dis-,over-	The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot-on, while the lamb was often dry and/or overcooked.
12481	-ance,-cy,-er,-ly,-th,de-,re-	The duck was a 65% glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy, crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments.
12482	-en,-er,-ing,-ont,de-,inter-,re-	Dessert was... hmmm, that's interesting, I don't even remember dessert.
12483	-ess	I guess that tells you a lot.
12484	-ate,-es,-ite,semi-	Oh, yes, the chocolate semifreddo was quite good.
12485	-ate,-ation,-ed,-ry,-ture,-ty,an-,im-	The warm chocolate cake was very tasty, but served at room temperature, not warm by any stretch of the imagination.
12486	-ad,-er,-ont,re-	And my--no, I still don't remember what I had.
12487	-able,-age,-ative,-ed,-ent,-er,-ial,-ing,-ly,an-,be-,com-,ex-,re-	Service was average, but nothing special, and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly, not merely capable.
12488	-ad,-ant,-ed,-en,-ence,-ent,-est,-ing,-ive,-le,-one,an-,at-,be-,dec-,en-,ex-,in-,re-	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests (and as the many golden reviews seem to attest), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience.
12489	-ad,-ate,-ent,-er,-es,-ic,-ing,-less,-ly,-tion,-ty,ac-,be-,de-,dec-,ex-,mid-,on-,un-	But one should not go here expecting something fantastic, unless perhaps you've never had middle-eastern food before, or succulent duck, tasty lamb, decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts.
12490	-ation,-ed,-en,-ly,-or,an-,on-,re-,to-	PS) When we called for a reservation, we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings.
12491	-ed,-en,-es,-ing,-ty,an-,em-	When we arrived at 5, and left circa 7, there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us.
12492	-ation,-ed,-ence,-et,-ey,-id,-ing,-th,al-,an-,di-,ex-,re-	Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all, and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience?
12494	-able,-es,-ing,-ly,-ment,-ome,ad-,ap-,un-	At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses.
12495	-all,-ase,-ee,-es,-ese,-ey,-ing,-ly,-ome,-ry,ac-,an-,di-	They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses.
12496	-ed,-ee,-ess,-ine,-ing,like-,on-	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model (by looking the dress up online).
12497	-ed,-er,-ess,-ing,-le,-or,-th,de-,to-	So, as I was leaving I asked for the designer/dress name or style number associated with my top picks.
12498	-able,-ed,-ess,-ey,-id,un-	They said they were "unable to tell me until they ordered my dress".
12499	-all,-er,-ess,-le,-on,an-,com-,de-,un-,with-	Hmmm... A person cannot call a company, if you have no idea its name (since the designer is unknown... SUPPOSEDLY), and order a gown without a dress name or style number.
12500	-all,-er,-es,-or	Do other brides fall for this???
12501	-ant,-er,-es,-ess,-ey,-ing,-ive,-ling,-ont,an-,be-,de-,re-,wan-	They either: a) don't want to give it to me because they don't want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b) are recreating the dresses themselves (ie STEALING other designers' dress designs and "filling the orders" by their own seamstresses).
12502	-ive,-ly,de-	I'm no detective but... uhh... seriously?!?
12503	-art,-ation,-ed,-er,-ey,-ing,-ont,-ure,an-,inter-	Whatever type of operation they are running, I'm not interested and if you're smart, you won't be either.
12505	-able,-ed,-er,-es,-ess,-ide,-ing,-ite,-le,-ling,-ry,ab-,ano-,com-,on-	Aside from that little *mystery*, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on.
12506	-ad,-ation,-ed,-er,-es,-ess,-id,-ing,-ly,-ome,-th,af-,an-,com-,de-,di-,dis-,exa-,on-,re-,to-	Somehow, since she supposedly doesn't know any names of designers/dresses, after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing, she knew "exactly which dress" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on.
12507	-en,-mer,-ont,-th,an-	My point: Even if I was wrong, don't sit there and argue with the customer.
12508	-ing	Say something like, "Huh.
12509	co-,di-	I didn't think so but you could be right."
12510	-ant,-er,-es,-ess,-et,-ing,-less,-ly,-mer,-ry,an-,ap-,for-,in-,like-,wan-	Unless you want to take the "tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she's obviously not loving" approach which will likely get you... uh... nowhere.
12511	-ly	Seriously: do not waste your time.
12512	-er,-ity,an-	Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners.
12513	-ey,-ide,-ing,-mer,-on,ab-,an-,co-,com-	Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service.
12514	-ant,-ar,-er,-est,-et,-ing,-one,-ry,-st,-th,al-,an-,ano-,be-,dis-,im-	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life.
12516	-ation,-ed,-er,-es,-ible,-ing,-ly,-st,re-	After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past, I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location.
12517	-ar,-ed,re-	I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire.
12518	-age,-ar,-art,-ed,-ee,-en,-er,-es,-ey,-ide,-ing,-ist,-le,-ly,-ome,-on,-one,-ont,-or,ab-,al-,an-,ap-,be-,bi-,in-,par-,re-,to-	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop (that is apparently what you are supposed to do, but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage, so you don't see them drving up, and they purposely block the front pull-up that all other Sear's use).
12519	-ad,-es,-ician,-ide,-or,-st,be-,in-	Once inside, I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before--FINALLY-- a technician got to me.
12520	-an,-ar,-ed,-ent,-ick,-ing,-ite,be-,bi-,re-	Once I returned to pick up my car, you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting.
12521	-ad,-al,-ard,-ed,-en,-ible,-ing,-or,an-,be-,re-,to-,wan-	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn't possible.
12522	-ad,-ar,-ase,-er,-ing,-ly,-ty,ac-,al-,an-,di-,ov-	Once I actually got back in my car, it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel.
12523	-ad,-ine,ex-,on-	OK, one bad experience...fine.
12524	-ad,-ar,-ed,-er,-es,-ing,-th,an-,re-	The following Friday, I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires, which were worn.
12525	-ed,-one,-ular,an-,co-,par-	I would not have gone back, but I couldn't find the particular tire they'd used in stock anywhere else.
12526	-ed,-in,-ing,-ite,-or,ag-,at-,be-,bi-	Once again, I waited for quite a bit before being attended to.
12527	-an,-ed,-en,-er,-ess,-ician,ab-,an-,com-,ex-	I got the order completed, and then questioned the technician since it came out about $40 less than I expected.
12528	-al,-ar,-ed,-er,-id,-ing,-th,ac-,af-,an-	He said it was the same tire, and verified this, after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week.
12529	-ar,-ate,-ed,-ee,-en,-er,-or,an-,ap-,co-,cor-	However, when he printed out the service quote, I could see that it was NOT the correct tire, and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model.
12530	-ad,-ed,-es,-ey,-id,-ly,cor-,on-	So I pointed this out to him, at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock.
12531	-ine	Ok--fine.
12532	-ar,-ed,-er,-st,re-	So I got just my other rear tire replaced.
12533	-ed,-ey,-in,-one,with-	They promised it'd be done within an hour, so I waited in the lobby.
12534	-ar,-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ey,-ly,an-,be-	Over two hours later (and ten minutes before they closed) my car was finally finished.
12535	-ar,-ed,-er,-es,-ey,af-,an-,in-	A few minutes after I left, I was called and informed that "I" left my wheel lock (which they should have left in the car).
12536	-es,-et,-ey,-ing,-ry,co-	Of course, they would be closing in 5 minutes, so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day.
12537	-es,-ey,-ly,-or,an-,ap-,co-,ex-	Of course I couldn't make it back in time (and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me).
12538	-ician,-ular,an-,co-,on-,par-	The next day, no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in.
12539	-all,-er,-es,-et,-ey,-ing,-ly,-one,-ont,-or,-th,ab-,ap-,be-,co-,em-,phon-,re-	Of course, they couldn't call him either to ask about it because apparently they don't keep their employees' phone numbers (riiight), so I would have to return on Monday (driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat).
12540	-ed,-in,-ing,-one,ab-,ag-,an-,bi-,to-	On Monday I called and again it was a big to-do to find anyone who knew anything about it.
12541	-al,-ey,-ing,-ly,-or,-ure,al-,hol-	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening, but I'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal.
12542	-ee,-es,-etic,-ly,-ment,an-,ap-,co-,com-,di-,em-	The employees at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there didn't seem to be any sort of management that I could see.
12543	-ar,-ed,-er,-ey,-in,-ious,-ity,-ly,-ome,ab-,ac-,ag-,an-,re-	I will never return there again (and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car).

12729	-ard	Great to have you on board!
12730	-age,-ed,-ee,-en,-ent,-ey,-ing,-le,-one,ad-,be-,con-,mon-,non-,pre-	Now, none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time, but it's an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something.
12731	-ar,-ase,-ent,-es,-ing,-le,-ment,-ship,an-,for-,re-	In this case, following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google-Mozilla/Firefox relationship.
12732	-an,-ed,-en,-es,-ia,-ic,-ie,-in,-on,-ory,-th,-ture,al-,an-,con-,histo-	If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson, with music by Aaron McLeran.
12733	-ate,-ia,-ie,-le,-on,an-	In this movie Google and Amazon (GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008.
12734	-ing,on-	This is one thought-provoking film.
12735	-er,-es,-le,-ry,-ture,-ular,par-	Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer.
12736	-all,-ar,-ible,-le,-ment,-or,-st,com-,on-	Just one small commment - it's not possible, as far as I know, for Google to "Aquire" Firefox.
12737	-ase,-en,-er,-es,-ey,-ing,-ole,-ose,ab-,al-,an-,re-	They already have rights to take it, alter it, and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about.
12738	-an,-ard,-ed,-er,-ey,-ing,-le,-ment,-st,-th,-ular,ad-,an-,con-,de-,en-,in-,non-	I'm inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non-Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development, they're ensuring the continued life of the project, and ensuring (not that I think they need to) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team.
12739	-ed,-en,-est,-ive,al-,en-,inter-	It's this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive.
12740	-ic,-ing,-ture	Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic.
12741	-or	Thanks for the link.
12742	-es	Malach, What you say makes sense.
12743	-en,-ent,-es,-ing,-ive,-tion,an-,anti-,com-,di-,in-	Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go.
12744	-able,-ably,-an,-ate,-es,-ess,-ing,-le,-or,-ture,ac-,an-,com-,in-,mis-	It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis-matches.
12745	-al,-ance,-ee,-en,-ence,-es,-ion,-ity,-ly,-ment,-ness,-th,-tion,al-,be-,deci-,for-,in-,mon-,on-	The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al-Sadr's movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance.
12746	-al,-ed,-ein,-en,-es,-et,-ful,-id,-ly,-or,-st,ag-,di-,in-,re-	How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites, who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein, against the United States?
12747	-al,-en,-es,-ing,-ite,-ive,-ize,-le,-ly,-ry,an-,co-,down-,for-,in-	Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously, at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country?
12748	-ant,-ed,-en,-er,-et,-ing,-ish,al-,an-,com-,con-,in-,re-	At a time when the Spanish, Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving, and the UN is reluctant to get involved?
12749	-ate,-ed,-er,-gon,-ing,-ment,an-,pre-	One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA.
12750	-al,-ate,-ation,-ence,-th,ad-,af-,an-,ex-,inter-	State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration.
12751	-ly,-ment,on-	The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up.
12752	-ad,-ative,-ed,-ence,-es,-ic,-or,-st,-th,-ture,ab-,ad-,an-,ex-,re-	Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives, most of whom had no administrative experience, no Arabic, and no respect for Muslim culture (or knowledge about it).
12753	-ate,-ed,-ey,-ick,-ly,-ment,ac-,ex-	They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick.
12754	-ate,-ed,-en,-ess,-in,-ing,-ly,-ment,-ry,allo-,be-,ex-,mes-,re-	(Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess.)
12755	-al,-ant,-art,-ee,-en,-es,-ey,-ial,-ic,-ing,-le,-ome,-or,-ose,-ry,al-,an-,co-,de-,eco-,ex-,im-,in-,par-,wan-	The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people, including Polish-style economic shock therapy, some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel, and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts.
12756	-eme,-ence,-in,-ling,-ly,-on,an-,ex-,in-	The Washington Monthly's Who's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double-dealing of many in the CPA.
12757	-ar,-ation,-ed,-er,-es,-ian,-ing,-ion,-ive,-or,-ose,ac-,ad-,prot-	Sept. 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow, who is close to the Bush administration, admitted on Sept. 10, 2002, that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "protect Israel," according to the Asian Times .
12758	-ant,-en,-ic,be-	I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists.
12759	-an,-ar,-ary,-ee,-en,-ent,-ey,-ing,an-,be-,extra-,re-	But they haven't been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks.
12760	-er,-est,-ing,-le,-one,an-,is-,new-	Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi.
12761	-an,-ed,-ence,-er,-es,-ly,-one,-or,-th,in-	This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at.
12762	-al,-all,-ant,-cy,-ed,-er,-ing,-ont,-pter,-st,af-,an-,be-,in-,post-,re-,wan-	There is a classical logical fallacy, post hoc ergo propter hoc (Z happens after X, therefore Z is caused by X), and I keep revising this posting this evening because I don't want to fall into it.
12763	-en,-er,-es,af-,be-,co-	But sometimes, of course, when Z happens after X it is because of X.
12764	-ance,-ed,-en,-er,-es,-ious,-ment,-ome,-on,-st,-th,-ty,an-,com-,pre-,re-,up-	So I may as well just come out with it: It is pretty suspicious, given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada:
12765	-al,-ant,-ed,-ian,-id,-ing,-ite,-ity,-ric,-th,an-,con-,ex-,radi-	' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group's "striking arm" in Iraq.
12766	-an,-ant,-ed,-ence,-er,-ese,-id,-ion,-ite,-ity,-or,-ric,-th,al-,an-,ex-,re-	"I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas," Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah, the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah.
12767	-ed,-ose,-st,-th,-ty,an-,mon-,par-	Last month, Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas.
12768	-ad,-ase,-ate,-er,-et,-id,-ine,-ing,-ome,-on,-th,al-,an-,be-,con-	"Let (Hamas) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same," al-Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa, his home base south of Baghdad.
12769	-ant,-ase,-id,-ment,com-,di-	He did comment on what he meant by the phrase. '
12770	-ad,-ed,-ent,-er,-es,-ide,-ization,-ly,-th,-tion,al-,an-,con-,de-,for-,in-	And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization, and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization, which leaves 7 US soldiers dead.
12771	-ed,-et,-ive,-ly,an-,for-,un-	The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget; but who provoked it and why?
12772	-ed,-en,-es,-ing,an-,be-,co-,con-,pre-	I'm not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing.
12773	-ad,-ed,-en,-id,-on,-or,-st,be-,is-,mon-,re-	Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for.

13566	-ance,-eme,-ian,-id,-th,-ture,de-,in-,re-	"The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel's scheme to destroy the Palestinians' infrastructure," Habib said.

13569	-ad,-ase,-ed,-es,-ic,-st,an-,in-,re-	Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire, and hopes to turn the Gaza strip "into a vast battlefield."

14566	-cy,-ment	I'm not fond of the Google-hates-privacy argument
14567	-an,-ar,-ation,-ed,-en,-er,-ing,-ite,-one,-ont,-th,-ure,-ward,ac-,an-,ex-,for-,in-,to-	(You don't need to use their site, you can opt-out of sharing your information, you don't need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account, and if -- wonder of wonders -- you're worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account... you have far, far too much time on your hands).
14568	-ad,-ar,-er,-ly,new-,re-,to-	However, this toolbar is really bad news.
14569	-er,-ol,-ty,co-,pre-	On the other hand, it looks pretty cool.
14570	-an,-ar,-ergy,-ing,en-,wan-,with-	Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons.
14571	-ed,-es,-ian,-ment,be-	The United States doesn't believe the Iranian Government.
14572	-an,-ian,-ment	One can suspect the Iranian Government.
14574	-ad,-ar,-art,-ian,-ine,-ing,-ise,-le,-ling,-ment,-th,ac-,an-,be-,re-,sym-	I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article.

14576	-ar,-ee,-en,-ent,-id,-in,-ped,-ry,al-,be-,co-,with-	The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he couldn't even begin to try without nuclear weapons.
14577	-ar,-ed,-er,-es,-ful,-or,in-,wan-	But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes.
14578	-an,-ant,-ary,-cy,-er,-le,-th,-ure,diplo-,pre-,wan-	Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure.
14579	-cy,diplo-	But will diplomacy work?
14580	-an,-ary,-one,-ure,an-,pre-,with-	And can anyone use military pressure without proof?
14581	-age,-ed,-en,-ent,-er,-ey,em-,re-,to-	One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage.
14582	-ed,de-	He has denied this.
14583	-ont,be-	We don't have to believe him.
14584	-ant	But we can't prove it.
14585	-en,-es,-ide,-ly,an-,be-	It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof.
14586	-an,-ed,-ent,-ity,-ly,-ry,anti-,in-	Angry crowds chanted anti-American slogans in the western city of Falluja (pop. 256,000) as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by US troops were buried on Saturday.
14587	-al,-ation,-ed,-ee,-ics,-ing,-ity,-le,-ling,-or,an-,con-,de-,gen-,is-,re-,to-	Reuters reported that "Sunni clerics in the town issued a 'Declaration by the people of Fallujah' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police, announcing three days of mourning, and calling for a general strike today."
14588	-ad,-ed,-le,-st,-tion,ag-,com-,con-,de-,prot-,re-	It read, "The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah.
14589	-able,-an,-et,-ing,-ity,-ive,-ty,ag-,an-,prot-	Let aggressive (American) leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city's security and safety, and ask them to lift their hands from the city."
14590	-al,-ed,-ics,-th,com-,de-	The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders.
14591	-al,-ed,-en,-er,-in,-ism,-ome,-th,be-,com-,radi-,re-	Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the US soldiers there, since local Sunnis either remain committed to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalists or even radicals.
14592	-ate,-ed,-er,-es,-ial,-ment,-th,an-,co-,dis-,en-,re-	Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country's wealth and power.

14595	-an,-ed,-eme,-es,-ing,-ion,-ling,-logical,-ment,-th,abs-,al-,an-,deci-,di-,in-,to-	The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D.C. Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5-3 decision that is 185 pages long.
14596	-al,-ing,-le,ac-,con-	The actual vote is a little confusing.

14603	-ad,-ee,-ile,-ing,-ion,-le,-ly,-ole,-th,agr-,re-	It will take me a little while to read the whole thing, but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion.

14605	-age,-an,-ant,-ar,-ate,-ed,-ent,-es,-ly,-on,-ont,-st,-tion,-ule,ag-,al-,an-,be-,co-,com-,con-,ex-,mini-,new-,on-,re-,up-	Important news such as President Bush's miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment/anti-gay (update: he's not against gays in the bedroom, just at the altar, where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages, or the A section, but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely.
14606	-ad,-or,re-	I had to go to the BBC for this report .
14607	-arian,-ary,-ate,-ed,-es,-est,-ic,-le,-ly,-ose,-th,bi-,new-,on-,sym-,to-	It's symptomatic, I suppose, of our fast-paced, 24 hour news-cycle lives, that the biggest short-term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed, once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour, from the newspapers.
14608	-ing,-st,dis-	It's just disappointing.
14609	-al,-ed,-er,-ling,-st,ag-,en-,ex-	Most troubling, however, is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed.
14610	-al,-an,-ary,-ed,-en,-ence,-ic,-in,de-,en-,step-,with-	At that time, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours.
14611	-ence,-er,-es,an-,con-	Two weeks later, and the violence continues.
14612	-an,-ed,-ing,-ion,-ly,ac-,ana-	The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace, pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15,000, according to analysts.
14613	-al,-en,-id,-ing,-ly,ac-,inter-,off-,on-,re-	And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs, according to the local UN officials.
14614	-an,-ar,-ation,-ed,-er,-ling,-ly,af-,ag-,an-,ap-,dis-,un-	So hear we are, two weeks later, after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan, and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged.
14615	-ation,-en,-es,-ing,-ly,-th,an-	Warren Buffett is giving away 85% of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
14616	-al,-ate,-ation,-ean,-er,-es,-ess,-ey,-fication,-ing,-ly,-or,-st,-ty,an-,com-,for-,mon-,pre-,re-	It's a move that really worries me; Buffett's usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate, so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later.
14617	-ard,-es,-ey,-ible,-le,-on,-ry,an-,mon-,par-,wan-	It's a little hard to parse, but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money-redistributors, and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible.
14618	-ed,-es,-ie,-ing,-ly,-on,di-	Which essentially sounds like he's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon.
14619	-al,-ant,-cy,-ed,-es,-ify,-ity,-ly,-on,-st,ac-,en-,re-	I assume his actual reason is that he's worried that Berkshire Hathaway just can't grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy.
14620	-et,-ure,re-	I'm not sure how the market will react.
14621	-ed,-es,-et,-ic,-id,-le,-or,-th,ad-,an-,com-,in-,ind-,on-	It doesn't change the company's intrinsic worth, and as the article notes, the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid.
14622	-ed,-er,-est,-ly,-ment,-or,-ry,-st,an-,be-,cent-,com-,in-,over-	On the other hand, this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century.
14623	-al,-arch,-ation,-ed,-en,-es,-ing,-ly,-ous,ad-,an-,com-,in-,re-	em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education, that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years.
14624	-ad,-ia,-ing,-le,-wise,de-,mal-,other-	Because the 10.000.000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead.
14626	-ar,-ase,-ate,-er,-es,-ing,-one,dec-,un-	He's not giving 85% away, he's giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5% a year (until gone?).
14627	-es,-ing,-th,de-	He mentions his wife's death having an effect on him.
14628	-al,-ation,-es,-et,-ey,-ide,-ing,-ose,-st,-ty,an-,com-,in-,mon-,pre-	It sounds pretty rational that he's saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot, so starting the money hose now is a good idea, but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound.
14629	-al,-ate,-en,-ent,-er,-es,-ing,-ist,-ly,-th,-ty,Euro-,ac-,an-,co-,ex-,for-,ov-,par-,ter-	Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN, even the leftist countries in Europe, are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party:
14630	-ary,-ate,-ed,-est,-ia,-ing,-ist,an-,ind-,par-,prot-,ter-,up-	On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .
14631	-al,-ate,-ed,-ese,-ess,-in,-ing,-ious,-on,-th,ab-,de-,ent-,with-	To the north in Lebanon, there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria's promised withdrawal.
14632	-ed,-er,-et,-ia,-th,-tion,agr-,al-,be-,con-,for-,un-,with-	Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun .
14633	-age,-al,-an,-ed,-er,-ey,-ing,-ize,-ly,-ped,af-,be-,ind-,mes-,re-	UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "recognize Hezbollah" after easily being duped by "the message on the placards they are using".
14634	-ance,-ate,-dom,-ed,-ia,-ist,-ly,-or,-ous,ac-,an-,ter-	This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media.
14635	-ed,-ee,-ent,-er,-ine,-ing,-ism,-ist,-ite,-ling,-ly,-th,ac-,af-,at-,de-,in-,is-,ov-,ter-	Over three years after 9-11, the United Nations, despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still cannot properly define the word "terrorist" , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts.
14636	-ance,-ate,-en,-ent,-es,-ia,-ism,-le,-ly,an-,be-,de-,re-,ter-	The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance, as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .
14638	-al,-ation,-ed,-ent,-es,-fy,-ia,-ing,-ion,-ious,-ly,-ness,-oid,an-,con-,de-,deci-,ex-,in-,inter-,on-,pre-	The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace, but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media.
14639	-ed,-en,-er,-et,-ing,-ome,-on,-or,ac-,an-,be-,in-,ov-	I've been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now, ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon.
14641	-in,-ist,-ization,-le,an-,ter-	This is a terrorist organization plain and simple.
14642	-age,-ate,-ed,-ey,-ine,-ization,an-,bar-,con-,to-	This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983, took Americans hostage throughout the 80's and now they should be considered a legitimate organization?
14643	-er,-ly,-on,-st,Euro-,an-,ano-,re-	This is just another reason to never trust the MSM, and certainly not the Europeans.
14644	-ad,-ate,-en,-er,-ic,-id,-in,-ling,-ly,-th,-ty,be-,co-	The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid, has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate (even if rather lukewarmly) with the Americans.
14645	-er,-ing,-ment	It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government.
14646	-ad,-ance,-ary,-ate,-ation,-ed,-en,-in,-ing,-or,al-,an-,be-,for-,par-,ur-	The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January, and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars.
14647	-cy,-er,-es,-ic,-ing,-ly,-ment,-tion,-ty,an-,con-,off-	That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing, thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government.
14648	-ade,-an,-ate,-ation,-th,at-,for-,par-	Az-Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans.
14649	-al,-art,-ation,-ed,-es,-id,-ing,-ity,-or,-st,-th,com-,con-,for-,par-	In a communique, the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "raiding forces" in the assault on a city, the population of which is Muslim (such as Fallujah) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins.
14650	-ation,-ed,-en,-es,-est,-in,-th,-ware,an-,be-,for-,par-,re-,to-	The Sunni AMS told Iraqis, "You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf, and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah.
14651	-al,-ation,-er,em-	Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral."
14652	-al,-ation,-ed,-ing,-ite,-ment,at-,for-,is-,par-,radi-	The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah, as well.
14653	-al,-ar,-en,-er,-es,-ic,-id,-in,-ing,-ion,-ity,-ling,-ment,-on,-or,-ous,an-,ap-,com-,di-,en-,for-,ill-,other-,re-,un-,up-	The statement said, "We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces, whether national guards or others, the majority of whom are Muslim, calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity, and we ask them to view this war as illegal."
14654	-ed,-ion,-ly,at-,fore-	It called a "ploy" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah.
14655	-al,-ant,-en,-ence,-es,-ial,-ics,-ing,-ment,-st,an-,at-,be-,con-,in-,radi-	The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before, last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf.
14656	-ad,-ant,-ed,-er,-es,-ite,-or,-st,an-,anti-,re-	Most Shiites, however, are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah, many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti-Shiite pogroms.
14657	-ed,-ent,-es,-th	President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words:
14659	-ar,-art,-ed,-ent,-es,-ic,-ing,-ling,-or,-th,anti-,co-,in-,par-,ter-	U.S. Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a "war with Islamic fascists," saying the term could inflame anti-Muslim tensions.
14660	-al,-ed,-er,-ic,-id,-in,off-,ov-	U.S. officials have said the plot, thwarted by Britain, to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda.
14661	-ad,-ate,-cy,-ed,-ic,-id,-ism,-ive,-or,-th,ad-,an-,be-,counter-,di-,ex-,ill-,ter-	"We believe this is an ill-advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism," said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations advocacy group.
14662	-ar,-ic,-le,-th,di-	Which is why he didn't say we're at war with Islamic people.
14663	-ar,-ic,-th	We're at war with Islamic fascists.
14664	-ence,-er,-ic,-ing,-ism,-ive,-ly,-th,ad-	By using the word "Islamic" as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism, hence the qualifier.

14703	-al,-all,-ed,-en,-ing,-ment,al-,be-,di-,radi-	If the statement is true, it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "picked up" by al-Qaeda.
14704	-ation,-ing,-ion,-ive,-ly,-th,after-,ag-,an-,con-,in-,re-	This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath.
14705	-ar,-or,ter-	It is a setback for the war on terror.
14706	-al,-an,-ed,-en,-in,-ly,-ty,on-	Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "Afghan Arabs" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden.
14707	-ade,-al,-an,-ed,-ly,-th,-tion,co-,de-,en-,ex-,re-	It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5,000-strong "55th Brigade" of the Taliban regime, though this is not the technical definition.
14708	-ed,-es,-ess,-ey,-ion,-ist,-ly,-ol,-ome,ex-,for-,in-,milli-,pre-	Because Usamah is Saudi, my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia's some 15 million citizens.

14720	-er,is-	The September 11 Panel will issue its findings on Thursday.
14721	-ade,-es,-ey,-in,-ped,mis-	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden's plot.
14722	-er,-ese,-on,an-,un-	Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush.
14723	-ad,-ed,-id,-ing,-on,-ry,an-,com-,ever-,ex-,to-	Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming, he would have expended every effort to stop it, and that so would have Clinton.
14724	-cade,-ite,-ment,-ness,de-	This statement is, despite its facade of fair-mindedness, so many weasel words.
14725	-ad,-ed,-ing,co-,com-,tri-	Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming.
14726	-ing,-tion,com-	The question is, "Should he have known it was coming?"
14727	-er,-es,an-	The answer is, "Yes!"
14728	-ation,-ed,-th,ad-,an-,in-,off-	We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq.
14729	-ary,-es,-ey,-ing,-or,ab-,al-,an-,com-	Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there, already in January or February of 2001.
14730	-ade,-ar,-ard,-cy,-ed,-en,-ent,-er,-es,-ie,-ing,-ism,-ory,-st,ac-,ag-,al-,an-,be-,con-,contra-,counter-,in-,ind-,pre-,ter-	Wolfowitz contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al-Qaeda threat, insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq, and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing.
14731	-ad,-ate,-ation,-ed,-en,-ent,-es,-ian,-in,-ing,-ist,-ly,-th,al-,be-,com-,con-,in-,re-,ter-	If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality--that was an al-Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al-Gamaa al-Islamiyyah, an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden-- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat.
14732	-en,-er,-ing,ab-,af-,at-	Even after the attacks on September 11, Bush was obsessing about Iraq.
14733	-ance,-ed,-id,an-,be-	Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50% chance that Iraq was behind them.
14734	-ence	(On what evidence?
14735	-ad,-al,-en,-er,-ly,al-,an-,be-	The hijackers were obviously al-Qaeda, and no operational links between al-Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found).
14736	-an,-ed,-es,-ing,-ly,al-,at-,in-,re-	Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, saying there were "no good targets" in Afghanistan.
14737	-ad,-ed,-er,-es,-ing,-or,ab-,al-,an-,ter-	(What about 40 al-Qaeda bases that had trained the 9/11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States??)
14738	-an,-en,-gon,-id,-ing,-ling,-or,-th,-ward,ac-,al-,co-,de-,di-	The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al-Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf, according to Bob Woodward.

14740	-er,-ey,-id,di-	Neither did Cheney, Rumsfeld, or Wolfowitz.
14741	-ey,-in,-ing,-ite,-le	They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam's great white whale.
14742	-ase,-ed,-en,-es,-ial,-in,-ism,-le,-ment,ab-,al-,an-,counter-,di-	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed.
14743	-ed,-ey,ac-,al-,an-	They were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to.
14744	-al,-ed,-et,-ick,-st,al-,an-,de-,ex-	Bush demoted Dick Clarke, among the most vocal and focused of the al-Qaeda experts, from his cabinet.
14745	-al,-ation,-ed,-en,-er,-et,-ick,-ing,-ist,-le,-mer,ab-,an-,co-,con-,ex-,off-,out-,radi-,re-,ter-	Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers, who outranked him, and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet's hair was "on fire" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists.
14746	-ation,-et,-ing,-on,-or,ad-,de-,on-	As for the Clinton administration, let me say one thing in its defense.
14747	-ad,-al,-an,-ar,-ed,-en,-er,-ial,-in,-mer,-on,-ster,-th,af-,allo-,de-	Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar, based from Pakistan.
14748	-an,-ase,-ed,-ent,-ing,-or,an-,pre-,re-	I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong.
14749	-ed,al-	You also need Pakistani air space.

14751	-ade,-all,-en,-st,ag-,co-	But in fall of 1999, Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif.
14752	-al,-an,-ary,-ed,-ive,-ment,-th,an-,de-,prot-,re-	The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban, and the new military government reneged on the deal.
14753	-en,-in,-on,-st,ag-,co-,to-	Musharraf told Clinton he couldn't use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden.
14754	-all,-ation,-es,-ly,-ry,-ure,an-,co-,with-	Look at a map and you try to figure out how, in fall of 1999, you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities.
14755	-in,-st,co-,for-	Of course, you could just go in by main force.
14756	-ase,-ation,-ed,-or,-ose,-tion,di-	But for those of you tempted in that direction, please look up Carter's Tabas operation.
14757	-ed,-ly	It should be easily googled.
