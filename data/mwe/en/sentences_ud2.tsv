25	Batawi-leaders-flat	(This is a largely Sunni Arab clan, and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec. 15 elections.)
26	Commission-Electoral-compound,Commission-Debaathification-compound,lists-party-compound,activities-Baath-compound	Al-Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec. 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office.

47	blocks-road-compound	They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year, which indicates they are the same people.
48	land-dream-compound	And there is nothing we can do about it really, people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land.
52	dwellers-slum-compound,spree-looting-compound	There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks, governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April, and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "This time we will be the first to loot, we didn't get anything the last time".
56	going-on-compound	I guess it's just the old new Arab 'Me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin, me and my cousin against my enemy', or 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' thing going on again.
58	Ahmed-Mansour-flat	They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town, and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al-Sahhaf.

60	of-course-fixed	He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al-Golan, but of course that is okay for Al-Jazeera.

65	peninsula-Arabian-compound	He added that "America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation, they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see", and that "the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged, defiled, and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters".

72	Nations-United-compound,Committee-Scientific-compound,Radiation-Atomic-compound,effects-health-compound,effects-health-compound	There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation-related health effects to most people exposed.
73	Protection-Radiation-compound,Society-Protection-compound,release-press-compound	This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following:
74	accident-reactor-compound,deaths-cancer-compound	One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions, and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation.
75	Federation-Russian-compound,Defence-Civil-compound,Disasters-Natural-compound	Many people still believe that to be true, even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters (EMERCOM of Russia) reported this in 1996:
76	ACCIDENT-CHERNOBYL-compound	CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT: TEN YEARS ON
77	Union-Soviet-compound,accident-Chernobyl-compound	In the last decade, there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and, to a certain extent, adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union (Wi940) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise.
78	Energy-Atomic-compound,Agency-Energy-compound,effects-health-compound	The prestigious IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects.
79	Years-Fifteen-compound,Accident-Chernobyl-compound	However, in April 2001, the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned. which contradict the earlier reports.
81	cancers-thyroid-compound	The dramatic increase in radiation-induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, which have been observed since 1991, continues to this day.
82	rate-birth-compound	...a drop in the birth rate, a deterioration in women's reproductive health, an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth, and a deterioration in neonatal health....
83	accident-Chernobyl-compound,rate-morbidity-compound	The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine - in the post-accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies: the morbidity rate is going up, the number of really healthy children is dropping, and disability is increasing .
84	poisoning-radiation-compound	As a parent, I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning.
90	Report-IAEA-compound	IAEA Report Lessons learned
118	therapy-radiation-compound	As a child in the 50's I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy (primitive at best!) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging--they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments....
119	xray-radiation-compound	Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray?
122	Children-Chernobyl-compound	The Chernobyl Children's Project (http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp) offers several ways to help the children of that region.
129	Bin-Laden-flat,Ayman-al-flat	What do the new al-Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization?
130	commanders-Qaeda-compound,Bin-Laden-flat	Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2/3s of the top 25 al-Qaeda commanders, the middle managers are not in close contact with al-Zawahiri and Bin Laden.
132	Gen.-Pervez-flat,States-United-compound	These are 1) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani military "president" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
133	corps-officer-compound,sympathizers-Qaeda-compound	Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al-Qaeda sympathizers.
134	Abu-Zubayda-flat,Khalid-Shaykh-flat,as-well-fixed,operatives-Qaeda-compound,turned-over-compound	His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, as well as nearly 500 other al-Qaeda operatives, over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US.
135	seats-parliament-compound,coalition-party-compound	Musharraf held elections in October of 2002, in which center-right parties did well, but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition, MMA.
136	Frontier-Northwest-compound,Province-Frontier-compound,Bin-Laden-flat,Province-Baluchistan-compound,border-Afghanistan-compound	MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province, which probably shelters Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province, also on the Afghanistan border.
139	schemes-crackpot-compound	All this is highly unlikely, as with most al-Qaeda crackpot schemes.
140	take-over-compound	But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan.
142	take-off-compound,Framework-Legal-compound,Order-Framework-compound	On the one hand, it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election, and to repeal the contentious "Legal Framework Order" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship.
143	People-Pakistan-compound	On the other, restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League-N and Pakistan People's Party, who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police.
144	issue-Kashmir-compound	On the other hand, the US should strong-arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue.
146	issue-Kashmir-compound	The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism, and even the threat of nuclear war, than Iraq ever did.
147	policies-fist-compound,Sharon-government-flat	2) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government.
148	cutting-off-compound	Response: The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas, and started the process of cutting off its funding.
149	pull-off-compound	This terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and attacks.
151	Bush-administration-flat,Bank-West-compound	But Sharon's iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace, and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza.
152	ratchet-up-compound,tool-recruiting-compound,States-United-compound	Sharon's hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas's terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further, which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al-Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States.
153	States-United-compound	Israel owes the United States at least this much, in this crisis, to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace.
154	Right-Republican-compound	3) Make Iraq another Afghanistan, using the Republican Right's own tactics against them.
156	so-that-fixed,turn-in-compound	By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives, the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side, so that they turn in the foreigners.
159	fetishism-market-compound	The Americans have to put away their free-market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households.
160	Ronald-Reagan-flat	We need an FDR in Iraq, not a Ronald Reagan.
161	Of-course-fixed,soldiers-US-compound	Of course, the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less-provocative local or international forces, the better.
162	cry-rallying-compound	Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn't nearly as good a rallying cry for al-Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out.
163	infiltrators-Qaeda-compound	The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al-Qaeda infiltrators, and it would be dangerous to take one's eyes off the former ball.
164	George-W.-flat,John-Edwards-flat	George W. Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president.
166	Bush-moment-flat	Let's just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999:
167	quiz-pop-compound	' Bush fails reporter's pop quiz on international leaders
171	Gov.-Texas-compound,Gov.-George-flat,President-Bill-flat,pick-up-compound	Texas Gov. George W. Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots, but President Bill Clinton says Bush "should, and probably will, pick up" those names.
172	quiz-pop-compound,Andy-Hiller-flat	The front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller, a political reporter for WHDH-TV in Boston.
175	President-Lee-flat	Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan, referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui simply as "Lee."
178	Gen.-Pervaiz-flat	Hiller asked, inquiring about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who seized control of the country October 12.
181	took-over-compound	Bush, in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan, also said: "The new Pakistani general, he's just been elected -- not elected, this guy took over office.
185	Ban-Test-compound,Treaty-Ban-compound	"Further, I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
186	President-Clinton-flat	A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush's comments.
187	David-Leavy-flat,Security-National-compound,Council-Security-compound	"It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments," said David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council.
188	Pervez-General-compound,Pervez-Musharraf-flat,military-Pakistan-compound	Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was, he seems to have confused coup-making with "taking office," and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military, then the world's strongest supporter of the Taliban, would bring "stability!"
189	because-of-fixed,Minister-Prime-compound,Minister-Nawaz-flat,back-down-compound,so-that-fixed	Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir, so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger.
194	Asia-South-compound,threat-security-compound	And, he didn't think he needed to know anything about South Asia, with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics--the latter a dire security threat to the US.
195	as-opposed-fixed	He couldn't tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less.
197	attempts-assassination-compound	Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11, under extreme duress from the US, elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself.
202	literature-campaign-compound,process-peace-compound,Ireland-Northern-compound	This is what Edwards' campaign literature said about his positions: "Edwards believes that the U.S. must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts, from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland.

208	crisis-Iraq-compound	As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis, some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti-American terrorism.
209	States-United-compound	Israel, however, is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States.
210	Minister-Prime-compound,Minister-Ariel-flat	Ironically, among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US.
212	movements-liberation-compound	The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements.
213	process-peace-compound,policies-line-compound,bombings-suicide-compound	The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard-line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings.
216	Farms-Shebaa-compound	It is estimated to have some 5,000 armed fighters, and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms, a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war.
217	war-Iraq-compound,environment-security-compound	Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel's security environment must, therefore, closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare.
218	Saddam-Hussein-flat,bombers-suicide-compound	Although it is often alleged (without much evidence) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare, it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel.
219	Strip-Gaza-compound,Bank-West-compound	The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations.
221	overtures-scenes-compound	At some points, as in the late 1980s, he reportedly made behind-the-scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal.
223	program-weapons-compound,stockpiles-weapons-compound	By the late 1990s, Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program, and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles.
226	Bush-administration-flat	The bungling of post-war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state.
228	Council-Supreme-compound,Revolution-Islamic-compound,Corps-Badr-compound,paramilitary-Corps-compound,Guards-Revolutionary-compound	The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, whose 15,000-strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
230	Ayatollah-Ruhollah-flat	The more radical Shiites, who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel.
231	Ahmed-Sheikh-compound,Ahmed-Yassin-flat	They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the leader of Hamas, last March.
232	Grand-Ayatollah-flat	Worse for Israel, the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites.
233	Saddam-Hussein-flat	These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein's regime, but have now organized and armed themselves.
235	coreligionists-Hizbullah-compound,sales-petroleum-compound	It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel, and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals.
237	such-as-fixed,route-truck-compound,movement-Salafi-compound	Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad, and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement, which is popular in Jordan.
238	groups-nationalist-compound	Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians, and those in post-Saddam Iraq are no exception.
239	Saddam-Hussein-flat	Whereas Saddam Hussein's dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control, they are now free to organize.
240	worry-security-compound	An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel.
241	reserves-petroleum-compound	If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq, its citizens will be able to benefit from the country's petroleum reserves.
243	interests-security-compound	Israel's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors, which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians.
244	Ariel-Sharon-flat,Bank-West-compound	Ariel Sharon's aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence.
246	occupations-twin-compound,Bank-West-compound	The promotion by the pro-Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened, not strengthened, Israeli security.

268	general-army-compound,Kalkat-S-compound,de-jure-flat	According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat, the difficulty for Kumaratunga's government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control.
269	peninsula-Jaffna-compound,Lanka-Sri-compound,Accord-Peace-compound,deal-defense-compound	A veteran of India's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment.
270	Council-International-compound,Resolution-Conflict-compound,talks-peace-compound	Kalkat, who currently chairs the independent US-based International Council on Conflict Resolution, said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers, India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks.

283	agreement-defense-compound,Lanka-Sri-compound,rulers-Sinhala-compound,process-peace-compound,member-TNA-compound,Sithamparanathan-P-compound	"Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process," TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement.
284	chief-army-compound,Nirmal-General-compound,Nirmal-Chander-flat	She added that recent visits to the island by India's top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island".
285	pointed-out-compound,Lanka-Sri-compound,million-45-compound,Nadu-Tamil-compound,Lanka-Sri-compound,peninsula-Jaffna-compound,Straits-Palk-compound	But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill-advised to be involved again, militarily, with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits.
286	force-peacekeeping-compound,Nadu-Tamil-compound,peninsula-Jaffna-compound	Apart from the 1,200 Indian lives lost in 1987, the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty.
287	Delhi-New-compound,because-of-fixed	The best option, now, under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work, although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion, ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession.

296	President-Pervez-flat,alliance-Islamist-compound,Maulana-Fazlur-flat	Two years ago, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements.
297	States-United-compound	As Pakistan's president had been telling the United States he was "forced" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman, this was an embarrassment.
299	States-United-compound	That distinction has now gone to the United States.
300	establishment-policy-compound,such-as-fixed,Strobe-Talbott-flat,quo-status-compound	Realists, and this even includes members of the U.S. Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott, who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia, understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo.
302	Delhi-New-compound	Simultaneously, New Delhi would ensure a degree of autonomy for the state that would help cut popular support off from jihadis attempting to convert Kashmir into a second Afghanistan.
303	Bill-Clinton-flat,Colin-Powell-flat,policy-U.S.-compound,at-least-fixed	Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet, under Colin Powell (who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics), the pendulum of U.S. policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India.
304	Christina-Rocca-flat,army-Pakistan-compound	This, Pakistan's lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca has been told, is the "minimum" that the Pakistan army will accept.
305	Delhi-New-compound	It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver.
306	problem-Kashmir-compound,Jammu-majority-compound,Valley-Kashmir-compound	This writer has for years regarded the best solution to the Kashmir problem as being the trifurcation of the Indian part of the state into a Hindu-majority Jammu, a Buddhist-dominated Ladakh and the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley, with the third state given little of taxpayers' money but substantial autonomy.
307	Valley-Kashmir-compound,East-Middle-compound	With luck, the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other locations where Muslims are dominant and become a tourist, education and services haven within India.
308	Department-State-compound,Army-Pakistan-compound	The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome, except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U.S. State Department and the Pakistan Army, which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971.
309	families-Hindu-compound	Unreported by the international media, the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded.

315	Department-State-compound,tanks-think-compound,Ibrahim-Rugova-flat	The U.S. State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and, in most of them, the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova.
316	Congress-National-compound,York-New-compound	That India is not Yugoslavia and that the "foreigner-led" Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore Indian nationalism, has not struck the conferees, among whom have been several Indian "scholars" and "analysts" ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna.
317	signing-on-compound,piece-ed-compound,Sonia-Gandhi-flat,Atal-Behari-flat	Despite many wrinkles, India remains a part-democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op-ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly.
318	community-business-compound,stepped-in-compound,rattling-saber-compound,pointing-out-compound	It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002, pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China.
319	destination-investment-compound,Straits-Taiwan-compound,Korea-North-compound	The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China, hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea.
320	quo-status-compound,as-well-fixed	Since then, India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement: a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well.

322	Manmohan-Singh-flat,ramp-up-compound,Delhi-New-compound,as-well-fixed	Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide, Musharraf will face the moment of truth: accept the inevitable, or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well.

332	George-Bush-flat,Dagger-Delta-compound	During his time in the Guard, George Bush flew the F-102 Delta Dagger fighter-interceptor.

334	Nhut-Son-compound,Nang-Da-compound,Hoa-Bien-compound,Muang-Don-compound	During this time, F-102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut, Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam, and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand.
336	George-Bush-flat	As far as George Bush knew, he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam.
337	George-Bush-flat	In all this so-called controversy, has anyone considered that perhaps George Bush just wanted to fly jets?
338	jets-fighter-compound	And, let's remember, flying supersonic fighter jets is dangerous!
340	George-Bush-flat,Guard-National-compound	Some reporters (you know, the ones with journalistic ethics) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard.
341	George-Bush-flat,John-Kerry-flat	For example, did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry?
342	Dave-Manzano-flat	What follows is the text of an e-mail sent to me by a friend of mine (thanks to Dave Manzano).
345	Guard-National-compound,years-Guard-compound	Bush’s National Guard years
347	George-W.-flat,Guard-National-compound	What do you really know about George W. Bush’s time in the Air National Guard?
348	show-up-compound	That he didn’t show up for duty in Alabama?
351	coverage-News-compound	News coverage of the president’s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else.
356	training-flight-compound	Fifty-three weeks of flight training.
357	training-interceptor-compound	Twenty-one weeks of fighter-interceptor training.
358	periods-training-compound,as-well-fixed	That was 80 weeks to begin with, and there were other training periods thrown in as well.
359	work-time-compound	It was full-time work.
363	racking-up-compound	After training, Bush kept flying, racking up hundreds of hours in F-102 jets.
364	Guard-National-compound,service-Guard-compound,requirements-service-compound	As he did, he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements.
368	hitch-year-compound	[In other words, Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969-1970 alone.
372	showed-up-compound,showed-up-compound	The numbers indicate that in his first four years, Bush not only showed up, he showed up a lot.
374	reports-news-compound,according-to-fixed,Michael-filmmaker-compound,Michael-Moore-flat,according-to-fixed,Terry-McAuliffe-flat,Committee-National-compound	That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “deserted” (according to anti-Bush filmmaker Michael Moore) or went “AWOL” (according to Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee).
375	campaign-Senate-compound	Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.
377	Col.-William-flat	Requests like that weren’t unusual, says retired Col. William Campenni, who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971.

384	School-Business-compound,showing-up-compound	Then, in 1973, as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School, he again started showing up frequently.
385	requirement-minimum-compound	In June and July of 1973, he accumulated 56 points, enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973-1974 year.
387	commitment-year-compound	Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years, four months and five days of his original six-year commitment.
390	stands-out-compound,interceptor-fighter-compound,pilot-interceptor-compound	A 1970 evaluation said Bush “clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot” and was “a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership.”

392	interceptor-fighter-compound,pilot-interceptor-compound	And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer.”
393	reports-news-compound,Globe-Boston-compound,York-New-compound,Times-York-compound	Now, it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush’s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times, on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now.

397	Kerry-camp-flat,Swift-boat-flat	The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans’ attack, but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons.
399	boat-Swift-compound,veterans-boat-compound,whether-or-fixed,showed-up-compound	In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “has yet to explain to America whether or not, and tell the truth, about whether he showed up for duty.”
401	boat-Swift-compound,episode-boat-compound	Now, after the Swift boat episode, the spotlight has returned to Bush.
404	as-well-fixed	And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well.

410	measures-security-compound,centres-balloting-compound	The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections, but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5,000 (or so) balloting centres.
411	centres-voting-compound	Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas.
412	Coalition-Iraqi-compound,list-Coalition-compound,list-Iraqiya-compound	Now that the picture is clear, the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi's Al-Iraqiya list.
413	Ayad-Allawi-flat	Ayad Allawi, and other ministers running on his list, have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning.
414	handed-out-compound,conference-press-compound	One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar 'gifts' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi, a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis.

417	positions-state-compound,outlets-media-compound	Al-Abbudi stated that "His Emminence" decided to openly support the list because "others" (obviously a reference to Allawi) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning.
419	Ahmed-Al-flat,minister-defense-compound,Hazim-minister-compound,Hazim-Al-flat	Ahmed Al-Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al-Sha'lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media.
421	TV-Arabiya-compound	One remark made by Sha'lan on Al-Arabiya TV, that he couldn't say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor.
424	Hazim-Al-flat,minister-information-compound,M.S.-Al-flat,statements-media-compound	Hazim Al-Sha'lan, by the way, is the son of the late Sheikh of Al-Khaza'il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister, M.S. Al-Sahaf, in his nonsensical media statements, which can be passed as jokes.
425	list-coalition-compound	The main Kurdish coalition list (PUK and KDP) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region.
428	party-Communist-compound,Assembly-National-compound	Many Iraqis, including conservative and religious Iraqis, are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party, probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly.
429	party-Communist-compound,members-party-compound	The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq.
430	base-support-compound	Its support base is much larger than what it seems.
432	party-Islamic-compound	Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks, others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party.
434	driver-taxi-compound	I had an interesting conversation with a middle-aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya, Baghdad.
435	worshippers-fire-compound	After asking me which tribe I belong to (thus assessing my sectarian background) he started hurling abuses at the Shia, calling them Persians, Majoos (fire worshippers), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can't mention here.
439	driving-out-compound	First driving out the Americans, then fighting the Shia back into submission (as in 1991).
441	driver-taxi-compound	Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region, Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice, which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement.
442	d'etat-coup-compound	I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba'athist old-timer who claimed that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal.
443	cells-Ba'athist-compound	On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba'athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command, even though many have formed seperate cells (often under Islamic labels) with their own leaderships.
444	as-well-fixed	He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments.
445	forces-security-compound	I concur that Ba'athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates, along with the capital, if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely.
448	Assembly-National-compound	The only hope now is that, following the elections, the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties.
449	rather-than-fixed,root-out-compound	I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics, since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba'athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority.
451	forces-US-compound,Nimr-Bu-compound,clan-Nimr-compound,tribe-Dulaym-compound	Very recently, US forces in Al-Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing Abdul-Razaq Inad Al-Gu'ud, Sheikh of the Al-Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe.
453	family-Gu'ud-compound,governor-Anbar-compound	The Gu'ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of Al-Anbar governor some months back.
454	Nimr-Bu-compound,Thamir-Madhlum-flat,Force-Air-compound,general-Force-compound	The Al-Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al-Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid-nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al-Dulaymi, an Air Force general belonging to their tribe.
455	Guard-Republican-compound	The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard.
456	Hassan-Sheikh-compound,Hassan-Al-flat,tribe-Lihaib-compound	Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al-Lihabi, of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al-Anbar, Mosul and Salah Al-Din.
462	Luis-Posada-flat	Remember Luis Posada Carriles ?
463	Herald-Miami-compound,interview-Herald-compound,operative-CIA-compound,condo-luxury-compound	Here's a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo, published yesterday.
465	government-US-compound	I thought the US government was looking for me.
467	Because-of-fixed,officials-Immigration-compound	Because of such talk, Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials.
471	government-US-compound	But comfortable among the thugs, Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron, the US government.
473	operative-CIA-compound,Michael-operative-compound,Michael-Meiring-flat	He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark-skinned foreigners want extradited, CIA operative Michael Meiring.
474	find-out-compound	Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines, that "If this harms me in any way, you will find my power then, and you'll find out who I am."
476	given-up-compound	Posada can be given up, but Meiring can't.
478	agencies-intelligence-compound,organizations-terrorist-compound	They happened in the Philippines which, like Pakistan, is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other.
479	Terry-Nichols-flat	(Ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines.)
480	Bush-regime-flat	The bombings implicated Muslims, and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit.
483	given-up-compound	But will Posada be given up?
485	Hugo-Chavez-flat	I expect it will be determined that, under "Strong Man" Hugo Chavez, Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial.
492	fiction-consensus-compound	His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "War on Terror."
494	Patriot-Disposable-compound,Jack-Terrell-flat	Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling- dating from the 1980s- is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot, by Jack Terrell.

499	Peter-Dale-flat,Politics-Cocaine-compound	Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell's whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics.
501	Due-to-fixed,agent-CIA-compound	Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym, therefore opening him to cross-examination by Wilson, the prosecution had a problem.
502	files-CIA-compound	They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson.
504	Intelligence-Naval-compound	The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the 'Office of Naval Intelligence'.
505	more-than-fixed	Wilson had been able to show that he'd had more than 80 "non-social contacts" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971, leaving the prosecution's case in turmoil.
506	Charles-A.-flat	Then Charles A. Briggs came to the rescue.
507	officer-CIA-compound,records-CIA-compound,Edwin-P.-flat,28th-February-compound	Third ranking CIA officer, Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd, 1983, that on November 8th, 1982, he had authorized a search of CIA records "for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P. Wilson, or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th, 1971, when he retired from the CIA."
508	Declaration-Briggs-compound	The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972, Wilson did not work "directly or indirectly" for the CIA since retiring.
510	District-Federal-compound,Judge-District-compound,Judge-Lynn-flat,threw-out-compound	Last week, Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston, Texas, threw out Wilson's two-decades old conviction.

856	Day-Latter-compound,Saints-Day-compound	Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints (FLDS) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890.
858	leader-FLDS-compound,Warren-leader-compound,Warren-Jeffs-flat,enforcement-law-compound,because-of-fixed,enforcement-law-compound,officials-enforcement-compound	Now, FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI's list of "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives," a move that caps law enforcement's dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years...[because of] the impact that the group's practices, law enforcement officials say, are having on the most vulnerable within the sect, particularly children and women.
859	Mr.-Jeffs-flat,million-110-compound,officials-government-compound,authorities-school-compound	When the FLDS under Mr. Jeffs (and his father before him) grew to some 10,000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $110 million; when it became clear that government officials, school authorities, and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect; when ex-members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges (mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds, state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously.

957	metal-death-compound,phenomenon-metal-compound,hypocrisy-over-compound,service-lip-compound	Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter-cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the 'Church-Morality' crowd, which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor, but doesn't apply that love very far beyond their own congregation.
958	catch-up-compound,dealt-out-compound	The last I checked, the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self-proclaimed (though false) Christians.

1005	principle-inversion-compound	They want to be identified as 'Christians', and I fully suspect that for some of them, the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage, and has a lot more to do with the black magician's practice of the inversion principle.

1079	partition-out-compound	In my opinion, people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems.
1081	metal-death-compound	In regards to death metal, the problem is, once again, a question of education, history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture.

1083	metal-death-compound	Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first 'death metal' artists.

1086	fundamentalists-literalist-compound	My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists, of any religion.
1089	structure-power-compound	Also, I'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now (and, in general, most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses.
1090	value-face-compound	It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush's claims to be a christian, yet many seem to do just that.
1093	single-out-compound	Whie I don't subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior (which I think is patently rediculous), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on.

1113	events-world-compound	I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events.
1115	put-aside-compound	Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood?
1116	media-world-compound	Because Israel and any problems related to it, in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media, is not the central issue, and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region.
1118	war-Iraq-compound	The millions who died in the Iran-Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel.

1126	league-Arab-compound	The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional, by any standard of the word, and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years.
1127	countries-member-compound,league-Arab-compound,States-Gulf-compound	The 22 member countries of the Arab league, from Mauritania to the Gulf States, have a total population of 300 millions, larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion.

1135	rates-Birth-compound	Birth rates in the region are very high, increasing the poverty, the social gaps and the cultural decline.
1137	ground-breeding-compound,networks-terror-compound,murders-suicide-compound	It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators, terror networks, fanaticism, incitement, suicide murders and general decline.
1138	States-United-compound	It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States, on Israel, on Western Civilization, on Judaism and Christianity, on anyone and anything, except themselves.
1139	grew-up-compound	A word about the millions of decent, honest, good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families: They are double victims of an outside world, which now develops Islamophobia, and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional.
1140	stand-up-compound	The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement, but they also do not stand up against it.
1141	people-business-compound	They become accomplices, by omission, and this applies to political leaders, intellectuals, business people and many others.
1144	War-World-compound	A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War, but we are already well into it.
1145	Conflict-World-compound,War-World-compound,III-War-compound	These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict, or perhaps we should already refer to it as "the undeclared World War III":
1146	murder-suicide-compound	*1. The first element is the suicide murder.*
1147	murders-Suicide-compound	Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular, if I may use this expression, only lately.
1148	World-Western-compound	Even after September 11, it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon.
1151	murders-suicide-compound,due-to-fixed,accidents-car-compound	The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents.
1153	murderers-suicide-compound	More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya-based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started.
1154	murders-suicide-compound,occupation-Coalition-compound	Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq.
1155	killings-suicide-compound	So what is all the fuss about suicide killings?
1161	coverage-media-compound,industry-tourism-compound	One such murder, with the help of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while, as it did in Bali and in Turkey.
1162	murderer-suicide-compound	But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer.
1163	World-Western-compound	This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World.
1165	security-airport-compound	We may arrange for the best airport security in the world.
1166	in-order-fixed	But if you want to murder by suicide, you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people.
1167	murder-suicide-compound,detector-metal-compound	Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector?
1168	period-travel-compound	How about the lines to the check-in counters in a busy travel period?
1169	detector-metal-compound,station-train-compound	Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses.
1170	theaters-movie-compound,halls-concert-compound,malls-shopping-compound	Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters, concert halls, supermarkets, shopping malls, schools and hospitals.
1171	hall-concert-compound	Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target, not to speak of killing the guards themselves.
1172	controls-border-compound	You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way.
1174	murders-suicide-compound	What is behind the suicide murders?
1184	murders-Suicide-compound	Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair.
1189	Paul-Bremmer-flat	There was certainly more despair in Saddam's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer's Iraq, and no one exploded himself.
1190	murder-suicide-compound	A suicide murder is simply a horrible, vicious weapon of cruel, inhuman, cynical, well-funded terrorists, with no regard to human life, including the life of their fellow countrymen, but with very high regard to their own affluent well-being and their hunger for power.
1192	pyramid-crime-compound	Like in the case of organized crime, it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid.
1193	dealer-drug-compound,corner-street-compound	You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner.
1196	States-United-compound	The United States understands this now, after September 11.
1200	murders-suicide-compound	Unfortunately, it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way.
1202	bombings-Istanbul-compound	The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning.
1204	wakes-up-compound	Until Europe wakes up, this unity will not be achieved.
1208	people-business-compound	It is often said that politicians, diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie, as part of their professional life.
1211	Mr.-Mouhamad-flat,conferences-press-compound,forces-US-compound	You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information, Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad.
1214	Mr.-Sahaf-flat,jester-court-compound	Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester, but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time.
1220	murderers-suicide-compound,cameras-TV-compound,audience-world-compound	It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance, arm and dispatch suicide murderers, condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras, talking to a world audience, which even partly believes them.
1222	pictures-horror-compound	Incitement by Arab TV, accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies, has become a powerful weapon of those who lie, distort and want to destroy everything.
1223	sets-TV-compound,operas-soap-compound,shows-game-compound	Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so-called martyrs, and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows.
1224	Jazeera-Al-compound	I recommend to you, even though most of you do not understand Arabic, to watch Al Jazeera, from time to time.
1227	murderers-suicide-compound,demonstration-peace-compound	A demonstration in Berlin, carrying banners supporting Saddam's regime and featuring three-year old babies dressed as suicide murderers, is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "peace demonstration".
1228	war-Iraq-compound,Bin-Laden-flat,activists-peace-compound	You may support or oppose the Iraq war, but to refer to fans of Saddam, Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much.

2100	so-that-fixed,afternoon-Sunday-compound	Saturday probably works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon!!
2109	standards-operating-compound	I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery.
2110	whether-or-fixed	On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.
2111	publication-Enron-compound	Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be sent)?
2112	in-lead-compound	Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?
2113	standards-operating-compound,activities-trading-compound	With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.
2114	standards-operating-compound,professionals-operations-compound,management-top-compound,standards-operating-compound	With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.
2115	reach-business-compound,operations-trading-compound	These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.
2118	point-starting-compound,standards-operating-compound,controllers-business-compound	The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers.
2119	controllers-business-compound	I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.
2120	report-exception-compound	And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.
2121	Rick-Causey-flat	My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year.
2123	Mike-Moscoso-flat,James-New-flat	Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New.
2124	whether-or-fixed	So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.
2125	Operations-Global-compound,Controller-Operations-compound,meeting-Controller-compound,report-exception-compound	Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?
2133	M-13.9-compound,M-11.5-compound	Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.

4577	Accord-Gas-compound,Proposal-Settlement-compound	Attached is PG&E's Gas Accord II (GA II) Settlement Proposal.
4579	Accord-Gas-compound,structure-Accord-compound,period-2003-compound	As an overview, this proposal: * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007. *
4580	user-end-compound,rates-transportation-compound	* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today. *
4581	rates-path-compound,customers-core-compound	* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers. *
4582	changes-rate-compound,charges-transmission-compound	* Offers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges. *
4583	markets-commodity-compound,projects-capital-compound	* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007). *
4584	stability-rate-compound,escalator-%-compound,projects-capital-compound	* Provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.
4585	due-to-fixed	The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events. *
4586	differential-rate-compound	* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential. *
4587	services-transportation-compound,users-end-compound	* Proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available capacity. *
4588	program-aggregation-compound	* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.
4589	Procurement-Core-compound,Incentive-Procurement-compound,Mechanism-Incentive-compound,holdings-capacity-compound,demand-core-compound,event-weather-compound	PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (CPIM) will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.
4590	meeting-Party-compound,San-Francisco-flat	This also will serve as a reminder that an all-Party meeting is scheduled at PG&E's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11, to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions.
4592	proposal-Settlement-compound,Rule-Gas-compound	The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal, an Attachment (a copy of PG&E's proposed Gas Rule 27), and a set of supporting workpapers.

4633	Harry-Kingerski-flat	Harry Kingerski
4636	increase-rate-compound,thought-out-compound	instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "modest" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings, not just determined by whim.
4641	gouging-price-compound	OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for "price gouging" is increasing.
4642	guy-fall-compound	The administration is hell bent on finding a "fall guy."
4643	spikes-price-compound	The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out.
4644	release-press-compound	His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "refunds."
4645	Loretta-Lynch-flat	On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers.
4646	Carl-Wood-flat	And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme.
4647	Barton-hearing-flat	At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds.
4648	wagon-band-compound	Bilbray joined the "gouging" band wagon.
4649	discovery-data-compound	The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "real" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works.
4650	commissioners-FERC-compound	On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel.
4651	structure-market-compound,single-out-compound	Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit.
4656	consumers-California-compound	In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) "played by the rules," but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.
4658	freeze-rate-compound	Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion---trying to finesse it.
4660	increase-rate-compound,increase-rate-compound	Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned and based on facts and evidence.
4664	participation-interview-compound	This is a request for your interview participation.
4665	interns-Analyst-compound	The Associate and Analyst Programs will be on the Penn, undergraduate campus interviewing summer Analyst interns next week.
4666	Due-to-fixed,reasons-business-compound,team-Penn-compound	Due to business reasons, previously scheduled interviewers from the Penn team have had to cancel their participation.

4696	Tom-Byargeon-flat,Kevin-Miller-flat,Ken-Loch-flat,projects-drilling-compound	Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling projects.
4697	activity-financing-compound,head-well-compound,supplies-gas-compound,trading-gas-compound,activities-desk-compound	This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities.
4698	program-VPP-compound,drilling-oil-compound,projects-drilling-compound,rather-than-fixed,projects-gas-compound	Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects.
4699	project-Medusa-compound,Canyon-Mississippi-compound,Blocks-Canyon-compound,Blocks-#-compound	They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 and #582.
4700	reports-reservoir-compound	The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003.
4701	type-Mars-compound,crude-type-compound,Gravity-API-compound,sulfur-%-compound	Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur.
4702	Delta-West-compound	Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore.
4703	finding-out-compound,WD-#-compound	Peggy is finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.
4707	barrels-production-compound	Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels.
4712	as-well-fixed	Please address, and I'll check with Legal as well.
4713	signed-off-compound	We typically only book deals when everything is signed off.
4715	David-Hoog-flat	David Hoog
4717	following-up-compound	following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty's authorization to enter into the agreement.
4718	transactions-term-compound	these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements.
4719	deal-derivative-compound,50-million-compound	the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then claims that it was not a valid contract.
4725	decision-second-compound	seems like a 5 second decision to me.
4727	liability-payout-compound	by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1-way.
4731	Mr.-Shankman-flat	Dear Mr. Shankman,
4735	department-EAST-compound,SERVICES-ENERGY-compound	The position is with the EES MMC EAST department / WHOLESALE, RETAIL & COMM, ENRON ENERGY SERVICES.
4736	dept-Resource-compound	It was posted on Dec. 11, but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on the internet, it is open.
4749	stop-bus-compound	Here's a story...as I was waiting at the bus stop (7:35am) to go to school, a lady approached me and asked if I'd make sure her daughter got on a certain bus.
4763	stop-bus-compound	After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived.
4764	driver-bus-compound	I told the bus driver where to drop her off.

4781	needs-Analyst-compound	The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately.
4782	event-Recruiting-compound	While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting event.
4785	interviews-round-compound,interviews-round-compound	We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon.
4792	million-1.65-compound,show-up-compound	Where does our 50% (the 1.65 million dollars) show up?
4795	Eric-Gonzales-flat	Eric Gonzales
4798	value-option-compound,movements-market-compound	This deviation shows that Eco definitely has a significant amount of option value which can be exploited with quick reactions and favourable market movements.

4804	$-3,300,000-compound,share-%-compound,$-1,650,000-compound	Net to Eco about $3,300,000 ( Enron 50% share about $ 1,650,000 )
4805	margin-desk-compound	Enron total gain not counting ENA's trading desk margin is $1,922,000
4812	Days-Business-compound	3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.
4814	rate-discount-compound,sentence-rate-compound	4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue.
4816	Factor-Load-compound	6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor.
4818	Authority-Govt-compound	8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?
4819	rep-ECP-compound	9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.
4821	Requests-Collateral-compound	10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.

4832	agreement-power-compound	I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form.
4833	Ed-Con-compound,market-Ed-compound	Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review.
4835	services-billing-compound,agent-billing-compound	1. The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
4837	provision-setoff-compound	If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so.
4838	provision-law-compound,language-form-compound	3. The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).
4839	due-to-fixed,majeure-force-compound,event-majeure-compound	Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs).
4840	payment-termination-compound	Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the interest of "saving space" than anything else...
4841	form-hybrid-compound	Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.
4842	forms-power-compound	If you are comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.
4845	Sarah-Dietrich-flat,Jennifer-Hillegonds-flat	P.S. Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16.
4846	start-up-compound	I will start up again in mid-July...

5103	Senate-state-compound,committee-Senate-compound,producers-electricity-compound,grid-energy-compound,prices-energy-compound	A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.
5104	Sen.-state-compound,Sen.-Joe-flat,Ana-Santa-compound,twists-plot-compound,coup-palace-compound	The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup."
5105	groups-consumer-compound,grid-energy-compound,energy-California-compound,crisis-energy-compound,business-buying-compound,producers-power-compound	Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.
5106	coup-palace-compound,Terry-Winter-flat,Operator-System-compound,caps-price-compound,generators-power-compound	The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.
5107	Gov.-Gray-flat,request-page-compound	Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.
5109	turn-over-compound	The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos.
5110	Davis-spokesman-flat,Steve-Maviglio-flat	Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter.
5112	office-relations-compound	Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office.
5113	spokesman-ISO-compound,Gregg-spokesman-compound,Gregg-Fishman-flat	ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct.
5115	because-of-fixed,caps-price-compound	At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps.
5118	coup-palace-compound,members-board-compound,producers-electricity-compound	What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power.
5119	times-12-compound	The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier.
5120	generators-electricity-compound,cap-price-compound	"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.
5122	generators-power-compound,traders-electricity-compound,Commission-Regulatory-compound	Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed.
5123	generators-power-compound	The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.
5124	cap-price-compound,capacity-generating-compound,Energy-Duke-compound,President-Vice-compound,William-President-compound,William-Hall-flat	"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.
5125	caps-price-compound,officials-energy-compound	Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials.
5126	laws-trade-compound	He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.
5127	producers-electricity-compound,caps-price-compound,market-energy-compound	In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.
5129	plan-pricing-compound	The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan.
5130	cap-price-compound	What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.
5131	producers-Power-compound	Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints.
5133	crisis-energy-compound	What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.
5134	request-emergency-compound,cap-price-compound	Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap.
5136	board-ISO-compound,cap-price-compound	Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed.
5137	request-emergency-compound,Charles-Robinson-flat,members-board-compound	In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made.
5140	caps-price-compound	With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.
5141	staff-ISO-compound,advisers-energy-compound,faces-poker-compound,going-on-compound	"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said.
5144	records-ISO-compound	Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show.
5145	$-30-compound	Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.
5146	rather-than-fixed	Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians.
5148	plants-power-compound	Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.
5149	order-emergency-compound	Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.
5153	Jan-Smutney-flat,chairman-board-compound,generators-power-compound,cap-price-compound	Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap.
5154	community-generating-compound	Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.
5155	Producers-Energy-compound	"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.
5157	board-ISO-compound,meeting-emergency-compound	The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions.
5158	members-board-compound,Maviglio-spokesman-compound	Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.
5159	James-J.-flat,Commission-Regulatory-compound,chairman-Commission-compound,decision-December-compound	James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.
5160	motion-emergency-compound	"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said.
5161	management-ISO-compound,operator-system-compound	"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."
5164	find-out-compound	"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said.
5166	Mike-Smith-flat	We should resurrect Mike Smith's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.

5924	President-Hu-flat,supplies-oil-compound,in-case-fixed	The connection, however, lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan.

5926	mouthpiece-government-compound,Sea-China-compound	But even before the incident the People's Daily, the government mouthpiece, had commented that competition over the East China Sea between the two countries was "only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy".
5927	deal-trade-compound,add-up-compound,times-three-compound	The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil-drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market.

5935	cent-per-compound	But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades, so has its demand for energy.
5937	ownership-car-compound,as-well-fixed,generation-electricity-compound	Its projected demand, boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation, has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year.

6024	media-news-compound	From what we hear from the news media, one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage.
6026	Carolina-North-compound,Coalition-Religious-compound,Equality-Marriage-compound,couples-gender-compound	Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same-gender couples.
6027	legislature-NC-compound	One of “NCRC4ME’s” major efforts is to collect signatures for the attached “Declaration of Religious Leaders,” which has been and will again be presented to members of the NC legislature.
6028	equality-marriage-compound,couples-gender-compound	It presents the case for marriage equality and states, “We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.”
6029	Constitution-NC-compound	A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session, so there is a real need for visible support for the “pro-same-gender-marriage” side of this issue.
6030	meeting-February-compound,Vestry-CHS-compound	At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration.
6032	congregation-CHS-compound	Furthermore, the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration.
6033	Carolina-North-compound,Coalition-Religious-compound,Equality-Marriage-compound	(Since the Declaration is written as coming from “religious leaders,” people who don’t consider themselves “religious leaders” can sign as “Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality.”)

6045	unit-family-compound	We can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit.
6046	States-United-compound,Constitution-States-compound	This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to "secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”
6047	Carolina-North-compound,Constitution-Carolina-compound	The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “inalienable rights” of human beings to "life, liberty, the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor, and the pursuit of happiness."
6050	struck-down-compound	The American laws forbidding interracial marriage, now struck down, were clearly discriminatory.
6054	couples-gender-compound	We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same-gender couples.
6056	unit-family-compound	We insist that no one, especially the state, is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults, whether of the same or differing genders, from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving, thus more fully human.
6057	as-to-fixed	We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural, theological and liturgical issues involved.
6058	traditions-faith-compound	However, we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction.
6059	couples-gender-compound	We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.
6061	marriages-gender-compound	We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at, or bless, same-gender marriages.
6062	marriages-gender-compound	Likewise, a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at, and bless, same-gender marriages.

6068	Samuel-Alito-flat	The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito
6069	Tear-Down-compound	He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances, Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
6071	President-Bush-flat,Samuel-Alito-flat,States-United-compound,Court-Supreme-compound	As many of you may have heard, President Bush has nominated a long-time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court, to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court.
6072	States-United-compound,Senate-States-compound	Under our Constitution, this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent, as described in our Constitution, Article II, Section 2.
6074	Samuel-Judge-compound,Samuel-Alito-flat	Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position:
6076	undergraduate-Princeton-compound,School-Law-compound	He graduated very high in his class, from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale.
6077	Judge-Appeals-compound,Court-Supreme-compound	He has a long and distinguished record, including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge, the next level below Supreme Court.
6078	Court-Supreme-compound,cases-Court-compound	He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases, and he can recite details from memory.
6083	President-Bush-flat	President Bush loves him.
6084	Court-Supreme-compound	Yes, it is true that some people don't like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court.
6087	Samuel-Alito-flat,Court-Supreme-compound	The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court, to be judging the cases Bush is interested in.
6091	Samuel-Judge-compound,Samuel-Alito-flat,Court-Supreme-compound,Justice-Court-compound,in-order-fixed,Executive-Unitary-compound,Theory-Executive-compound,Court-Supreme-compound	That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito, in my opinion, because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice: He does not really agree with the system of "Checks and Balances" built into the Constitution, and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "Unitary Executive Theory," which calls for vastly-increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court.
6092	because-of-fixed	And because of this tragic flaw . . .
6093	Tear-Down-compound	"He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances, Giving Far Too Much Power To The President."
6094	Government-Federal-compound	In our Constitutional system, we have three branches of the Federal Government: the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches.
6096	Samuel-Alito-flat,Executive-Unitary-compound,Theory-Executive-compound	But Samuel Alito believes in a little-known Constitutional theory - called the "Unitary Executive Theory" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch, and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does, including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control, and the Military, which exists, which is regulated, and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress, not to the President.
6098	Court-Supreme-compound	"Commander In Chief" doesn't mean that he is the boss of the Military, merely that he is the Administrator, just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch, charged with "executing faithfully" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court.
6099	Executive-Unitary-compound,Theory-Executive-compound,Court-Supreme-compound	Under the Unitary Executive Theory, the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them.
6100	Court-Supreme-compound	And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President, with no real authority over him.
6101	backed-up-compound	And the President becomes a Dictator, unrestrained by anything in the Constitution, backed up by the Armed Forces, which would be entirely under his personal control.
6102	States-United-compound,Germany-Nazi-compound,War-World-compound	And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship, no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II.
6103	SAMUEL-ALITO-flat	AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO.

6155	attempt-surprise-compound	At least one expert believes China's intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA's planned lunar return.
6156	John-E.-flat,tank-think-compound	"The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly," said John E. Pike, director of the Alexandria, Va.-based GlobalSecurity.org, a small national security think tank.
6157	uno-numero-compound	"There is always the possibility they could jam us up, make us look like we are not numero uno," Pike said.
6158	War-Cold-compound,8-Apollo-compound,crew-8-compound,holidays-Christmas-compound	During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War, NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays.

6163	rocket-lift-compound,V-March-compound,launch-space-compound,complex-launch-compound,Island-Hainan-compound,Sea-China-compound	Pike's concern is based on China's development of a new medium-lift rocket, the Long March V, and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea.
6164	program-space-compound	The two developments, he said, could eventually enable China's space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth's orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home.
6168	rights-animal-compound,news-rights-compound	I'm a member of a local animal rights news, and get regular emails from other members and the staff.
6169	Cats-Civet-compound,so-that-fixed	Recently, I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires, so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes.
6170	instead-of-fixed	The animals eventually die, which is because these demons are so GREEDY, they want as much of their "product" as they can get, instead of letting the cats go after a point, as an act of humanity, mercy, love.

6182	went-on-compound	Well, sure enough, when I heard the cats "Meowing," I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living, what went on in their tiny, sweet little minds, and decided that I want to do something about this torture.

6194	suffering-animal-compound	This is my first time posting to the list, so I feel somewhat embarrassed by "promoting" a song I wrote, but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy, but an abundance of human greed.

6320	ate-up-compound,Hood-Riding-compound,blew-down-compound,Pigs-Little-compound,Wolf-Bad-compound	Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood's grandma and blew down the houses of two-thirds of the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation.
6321	because-of-fixed,population-remnant-compound,Royale-Isle-compound,Park-National-compound,Superior-Lake-compound	In part because of that reputation, the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s, except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan's Lake Superior.
6322	Park-National-compound	The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943.
6323	campaign-extermination-compound	Western sheep and cattle ranchers, on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted, gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done.
6327	park-Wyoming-compound	In the 1960s, a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves, then released them when their shooting was done.
6332	range-home-compound,Mountains-Rocky-compound	Eventually, a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains.
6334	packs-wolf-compound	These wolf packs have flourished, and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies, where merely 10 years ago there were none.
6335	predator-keystone-compound	One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator, an animal that affects the populations, behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range.
6336	University-State-compound	Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea.
6337	professors-forestry-compound,William-professors-compound,William-Ripple-flat,Robert-Beschta-flat,stabilization-bank-compound,Hood-Riding-compound,Pigs-Three-compound	OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream-bank stabilization, although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "the ecology of fear" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf's relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs.
6338	erosion-soil-compound	They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams, a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion.
6339	banks-stream-compound	Since reintroduction, however, Ripple and Beschta have found, fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings.
6340	Ed-Bangs-flat,recovery-wolf-compound,coordinator-recovery-compound,Planet-Blue-compound	"All you have to do is look at the photographs," Ed Bangs, wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told UPI's Blue Planet,
6342	ball-billiard-compound	An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow."
6345	colony-beaver-compound	Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park's northern range before the wolves returned, now there are nine.
6346	Planet-Blue-compound	"It may be uninteresting to a lot of people," Beschta told Blue Planet.
6349	recovery-wolf-compound,plants-streamside-compound	Since wolf recovery, streamside plants, willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers, a whole variety of avian species, berry-producing shrubs that bears can use.
6351	strength-root-compound,stability-bank-compound	The plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability.
6352	ecosystems-wildland-compound	Plants are critical to wildland ecosystems."
6353	herd-elk-compound	Yellowstone has a vast elk herd, one of the largest in the world.
6359	reintroduction-Wolf-compound,list-species-compound	Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal's status from endangered to threatened and, eventually, to remove it from the endangered species list altogether.
6360	packs-wolf-compound	Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies, as required by federal regulations.
6362	District-Federal-compound,Court-District-compound,Judge-Court-compound,Judge-Robert-flat	On Jan. 31, Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E. Jones appeared to agree with them.
6363	decision-FWS-compound	He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf's status.
6367	wolf-Yellowstone-compound,highway-Colorado-compound	A Yellowstone wolf was found dead, hit by a car, on a Colorado highway last year, several hundred miles from home.
6369	lions-mountain-compound	There are only about 850 wolves in the West, but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain lions.
6370	lions-mountain-compound	Pound for pound, mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves.
6371	Grimm-Brothers-compound	They even occasionally attack people, which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm.
6372	lions-mountain-compound	Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions, despite the risks.
6374	prior-to-fixed	Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction?
6376	hybrids-wolf-compound,States-United-compound	True, there are about 300,000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States.
6377	Park-Glacier-compound	It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance, a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago.
6379	testing-DNA-compound,wolves-Rockies-compound	He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves, scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants.

6387	Celsius-degrees-compound	Scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends, but meanwhile Earth's plants, insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome.
6389	turns-out-compound	It turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non-human natural world to changing conditions, and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming.
6390	Nina-Leopold-flat,ecologist-plant-compound,pioneer-conservation-compound,Aldo-Leopold-flat,Academy-National-compound	Nina Leopold Bradley, a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold, published a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61-year uninterrupted phenological records.
6391	cycle-life-compound	Phenology studies an organism's development and life cycle -- the pulse of life.
6392	prior-to-fixed	Bradley's record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999, spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data.

6399	Change-Climate-compound,States-United-compound,Center-Pew-compound,Climate-Global-compound	"One of the major, most well-documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities," concluded a report titled "Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States," released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week.
6400	researchers-Pew-compound	Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology.
6401	change-climate-compound,Camille-Parmesan-flat	"Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change," said Camille Parmesan, a University of Texas-Austin biologist and one of the world's leading experts on this issue.
6403	States-United-compound	"Across the United States, the northern edge of species' range is expanding," she said.
6404	butterfly-checkerspot-compound	Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly, which migrates between Mexico and southern California.
6407	extinctions-population-compound	"There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable."
6408	event-extinction-compound,population-checkerspot-compound,signal-temperature-compound	According to Parmesan's earlier studies, one extinction event, for instance, was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely, relying on a warming temperature signal, then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat.
6409	States-United-compound	Throughout the United States, she said, "spring is about two weeks earlier.
6410	swallows-Tree-compound	Tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier.
6411	Coast-Gulf-compound	Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast.
6413	report-Pew-compound,change-climate-compound,ecosystems-U.S.-compound	As the Pew report concluded, "Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U.S. ecosystems."
6414	composition-species-compound	Such consequences include shifting and, in some cases, contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems.
6415	processes-ecosystem-compound,such-as-fixed,cycling-carbon-compound	The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage.
6416	sink-net-compound,dioxide-carbon-compound,source-net-compound,matter-plant-compound	The Alaskan tundra, for instance, has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "being a net source of CO2 (releasing more carbon than is stored) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2."
6417	report-Pew-compound,Climate-Arctic-compound,Impact-Climate-compound,Assessment-Impact-compound	The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the "Arctic Climate Impact Assessment."
6418	States-United-compound,Federation-Russian-compound	The ACIA -- with participation by the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000.
6419	chair-ACIA-compound,Robert-chair-compound,Robert-Corell-flat	"The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic," said ACIA chair Robert Corell.
6420	change-climate-compound	"The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth.
6421	change-climate-compound	The impacts of climate change on the region and the globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come."
6422	temperatures-winter-compound,degrees-Fahrenheit-compound	The ACIA found Arctic winter temperatures have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years.
6423	ice-sea-compound,ice-sea-compound	Arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century, the assessment found, with some models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice.
6424	Ocean-Arctic-compound,species-seal-compound	"Should the Arctic Ocean become ice-free in summer, it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction," the report concluded.
6425	research-climate-compound	As with so much climate research, not everyone agrees with these dire predictions.
6426	Change-Climate-compound,Network-Policy-compound	A third report, "The Impacts of Climate Change: An Appraisal for the Future," completed by the Britain-based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two, falls somewhat into that category.
6427	report-IPN-compound,models-Climate-compound,rises-temperature-compound	On the one hand, the IPN report agreed "Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise.
6428	cover-ice-compound,absorption-surface-compound	This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase."
6429	Atlantic-North-compound,fisheries-Atlantic-compound	On the other hand, the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries.
6430	stocks-fish-compound,report-IPN-compound	"The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge," the IPN report said.
6431	Atlantic-North-compound	"A warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the North Atlantic."
6432	such-as-fixed,lobster-Norway-compound	The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod, haddock, saithe, herring, blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster.
6433	halibut-Greenland-compound	Important species that probably would decline include shrimp, capelin, Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish.
6434	list-laundry-compound,researchers-Pew-compound,debate-warming-compound	Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate.
6435	report-IPN-compound,species-fish-compound,such-as-fixed	The IPN report examines commercial fish species, but it neglects important non-commercial animals, such as seals and polar bears.
6437	butterflies-checkerspot-compound	The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears, checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables.
6438	researchers-Pew-compound	The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument.
6439	news-warming-compound	They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non-commercial species, and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy.

8585	point-melting-compound	Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn't get hot enough.
8586	charcoal-barbecue-compound	I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal (e.g. for blacksmithing one needs coal, not barbecue charcoal).
8587	casting-metal-compound	I have done a fair amount of metal casting, but never tried to build my own furnace, but I think your version is just too small and doesn't get hot enough.
8588	torch-propane-compound,torch-plumbers-compound,cylinders-propane-compound,grill-gas-compound	I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch (much larger than the plumbers torch, but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill).

8652	jaws-snakes-compound	iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once, snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing, so why not give her a good hunt, but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something,, lol i dont know, i agree with you though throw him, haha
8654	container-tupperwear-compound,passes-out-compound	Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it.
8656	end-up-compound	I don't like that option though - I think it's pretty cruel and I'd not done properly you'll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake.
8657	idea-tupperwear-compound	I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane.
8658	passes-out-compound,beat-heart-compound	You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point, it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive.

9252	snake-king-compound	You can tell when your king snake is about to shed, because its eyes will get milky looking.
9268	backed-off-compound	only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine.
9269	playing-roughhouse-compound	were they roughhouse playing?
9276	fighting-off-compound	right now, your male is fighting off an intruder, and he feels that all of the house is his.
9281	calm-down-compound	she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn't now.
9284	as-well-fixed	as well, your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened.
9285	room-one-compound	when the door opens, he will get that the one room is hers, and he will be OK with that.
9286	thing-territory-compound	the territory thing will be solved.
9289	set-up-compound	give them time to set up their territories, and once you bring the new kitten out, pay a lot of attention to the male.
9292	fight-play-compound	when they play fight, they don't hiss.
9308	Vietnam-North-compound,offensive-Tet-compound	What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive?
9309	Vietnam-South-compound	When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half-million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam.
9312	instead-of-fixed	This left Westmoreland with few options, so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is, in the long run, the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency.
9314	movement-guerilla-compound,VC-Force-compound	The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC (the guerilla movement), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC (which was light infantry) and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).
9315	stand-up-compound,firepower-US-compound	When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower, and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia.
9317	clean-out-compound,bases-Communist-compound	However, Johnson would not let the military cross the borders and clean out the Communist bases.
9318	building-up-compound	He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack, but he ignored his military advisers.
9321	Offensive-Tet-compound	However, what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations.
9326	leave-holiday-compound	The ARVN rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked.
9327	assault-Communist-compound	Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue.
9334	military-US-compound	The people rejected their attempt to topple the government, and for all intents and purposes the US military (and the ARVN) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time-frame he ordered it.
9335	finish-off-compound,forces-Communist-compound	All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces.
9337	Vietnam-North-compound,Vietnam-North-compound	Instead he pulled the military off, stopped the bombing of North Vietnam, withdrew from the presidential race, and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam.
9338	screwed-up-compound	They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it.
9339	Richard-Nixon-flat	The American people were NOT having any of it, and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made (not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding).
9345	in-that-fixed	Before Tet, the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the VC and NVA.
9347	Vo-General-compound,Vo-Nguyen-flat	There is a very good book on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap.
9349	question-dragon-compound	Bearded dragon question...?
9351	lamp-spot-compound,rays-UVA-compound	I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35% more light/heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well-being of him.
9352	rays-sun-compound	My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat, but the "sun rays" he needs?
9354	smart-pet-compound	The lady at pet smart said 4 hours, but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours.
9356	food-juvenile-compound	I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze- dried crickets.
9359	time-day-compound	Let me try to break this down as simply as I can: diurnal (active during the day time) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "light," UVA, UVB, and heat.
9360	light-white-compound,source-light-compound,bulbs-heat-compound	Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA, including heat bulbs, that's the easy one to provide for.
9362	lamp-heat-compound,vapor-mercury-compound,bulb-vapor-compound,use-reptile-compound,bulb-use-compound	UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp, unless you use a MVB (mercury vapor bulb) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb.
9363	bulbs-UVB-compound,damage-eye-compound,not-to-fixed,output-UVB-compound	I highly recommend that you do not use coiled/compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and/or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time.
9364	bulbs-UVB-compound,model-Repsitun-compound,bulbs-UVB-compound,according-to-fixed	The long tube UVB bulbs are best, like Zoomed's Repsitun model: http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturers recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is.
9366	lighting-UVB-compound	You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting.
9367	store-pet-compound,employees-store-compound,record-track-compound,care-pet-compound,info-care-compound	The person at Petsmart is very wrong; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you; they don't have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info.
9369	source-food-compound,insects-feeder-compound	Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source; you need to offer live feeder insects.
9371	food-Live-compound	Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried.
9372	worms-silk-compound,roaches-feeder-compound,insects-staple-compound	Crickets, silk worms, phoenix worms, and various feeder roaches, like red-lobster, turkistan, and dubia, are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded.
9373	worms-Wax-compound	Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items, for variety's sake.
9374	set-up-compound	I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly:
9379	tank-fish-compound,lights-UV-compound	either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven.
9380	as-to-fixed,rays-UV-compound	as to what the light provides it gives UV rays..which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans.
9382	rays-sun-compound	Yes, it gives him the "sun rays" necessary, that's what UVA is.
9384	As-for-fixed	As for the heat, just be sure to use a thermometer.
9385	whether-or-fixed	Also, Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving, so its anyone's guess whether or not he'll touch the freeze-dried crickets or the processed food.
9387	veggies-leafy-compound	Also try green leafy veggies, like kale and spinach.
9390	list-christmas-compound	I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like, and i was wondering : which would not bite alot, and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly dont care but my family does !
9397	ended-up-compound,finches-zebra-compound	I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas.
9416	level-noise-compound	They are both about the same noise level.
9418	feathers-vent-compound,feathers-vent-compound,ring-circle-compound	(the younger the eaiser to tame) Look for clean smooth feathers, beak, and clean vent feathers (the feathers around the butt..dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy) Look for a dark eye with no circles (the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes).
9422	piece-nostrils-compound	If you want a boy the cere (the nostrils piece above the beak) must be blue.
9431	more-than-fixed	However if you plan on getting one, then get more than one at the same time they need company.
9441	spray-millet-compound	Then I sat on the couch, placed one hand in the cage, holding a millet spray.
9442	turned-on-compound	(this way the will associate your hand with food, and birds love food lol) Then I turned on the tv and watch.
9446	spray-millet-compound	3) After about day 2, they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand.
9447	take-away-compound,dish-food-compound,takes-away-compound	(do not take away the food dish from the birds, they will associate you as the person who takes away their food)....
9451	go-up-compound	When they see that you arnt harming them, the will go up on your finger when you say up.
9455	give-up-compound	Dont give up!
9471	months-autumn-compound	We don't want it to be too cold (not sure when exactly there fall is... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months), but we don't feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either.
9476	woollies-winter-compound	It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February, but winter woollies in March and even during the summer.
9479	Kerry-County-compound	County Kerry is the worst affected.
9483	turn-on-compound	In summer, from May to July, the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long: at the height of summer you won’t need to turn on lights until after 10pm.
9484	season-tourist-compound	It is also peak tourist season, which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island, and prices are at their highest.
9485	so-as-fixed	Not surprisingly, most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather.
9486	destination-tourist-compound,tourism-season-compound	Spring (February to April) and Autumn (August to October) make good alternatives, although the country’s ever-growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid- and high-season tourism.
9487	principle-uncertainty-compound	Still, you have a better chance of some peace and quiet, and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid-July – again, it’s all part of the uncertainty principle.
9488	festivities-Spring-compound,Patrick-St-compound	Spring festivities include the ever-popular St Patrick’s Festival.
9490	attractions-tourist-compound,close-down-compound	Crowds are at their thinnest, but many of the country’s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don’t reopen until Easter, which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish: it’s cold, grey and dark by 5pm, but there’s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down.
9491	layer-up-compound,take-off-compound,warms-up-compound	The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you, clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up.
9493	Billy-Connolly-flat	As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes"
9494	luck-pot-compound	Afraid I cannot be more helpful, it is really a case of pot luck, although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa.
9502	tour-bus-compound,peninsula-Dingle-compound	You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists.
9503	put-up-compound	By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way.
9507	August-mid-compound,according-to-fixed	Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender.
9509	time-Spring-compound	We had frosts in October so I wouldn't advise visiting late in the year to be honest, Spring time is your best bet.
9511	saved-up-compound,money-spending-compound	You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights, insurance, food, accommodation & spending money.

9532	Check-out-compound	Checkout the second source.
9534	vial-medicine-compound,bobber-fishing-compound	Use a well rinsed medicine vial, a cork, new fishing bobber or even a piece of non-crumbly styrofoam to float them.
9535	ways-couple-compound,setting-up-compound	There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks, picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated, seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there.
9536	changes-water-compound	If you have the room to separate the male(s) & females(s),& feed them well on live foods, (assuming that you are doing weekly 50% water changes) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs.
9537	making-up-compound	Just making up examples, but if a pair is constantly together, they may lay 10-15 eggs a day.
9542	changes-water-compound	The water changes help with that too.
9543	water-incubation-compound	You also may need to treat the incubation water.
9545	water-tap-compound	Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
9546	treatment-water-compound	THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "breathe".
9549	mate-tank-compound,such-as-fixed	1. Is a tank mate (such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails) rating the eggs?
9550	kept-up-compound,changes-water-compound	2. Have we kept up with partial water changes?
9552	lineatus-Aplo.-compound	Aplo. lineatus are wide-spread over southern India.
9553	chemistries-water-compound	That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries.
9554	shop-pet-compound	Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS (total Dissolved Solids) test, that may give you a hint.
9556	meters-TDS-compound,meter-hardness-compound,department-water-compound	TDS meters (the thrifty aquarist's hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department's annual reports.
9557	figure-out-compound,minerals-hardness-compound	They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals (calcium, magnesium and iron).
9559	chloride-sodium-compound,break-down-compound	However if there is a high level of sodium chloride (common salt) that can break down the chorion (shell) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo.)
9560	water-tap-compound	Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
9561	treatment-water-compound	THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "breathe".
9562	vial-medicine-compound	If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial, that is fine.
9563	water-tap-compound,water-incubation-compound	But get the eggs out, maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water.
9564	container-shipping-compound	In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container.
9565	deaths-mystery-compound,people-killie-compound,change-water-compound,material-waste-compound	After a number of people began complaining about "mystery deaths"among incubating eggs, some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7-8 days of incubation, one should do a 100% water change - as the eggs develop, they do release waste material.
9567	solution-Acriflaven-compound,slow-down-compound	Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus, so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper.
9569	broke-down-compound	If an egg turns blue, it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down.

9621	seating-dinner-compound	We liked getting the late dinner seating, so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are 'early to bed' you may want the earlier seating for dinners.
9625	phones-Cell-compound	Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a 'walkie-talkie' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard.

12044	experience-service-compound,guy-tire-compound,putting-on-compound	It's without a doubt, the best service experience I've ever had and just to be clear, the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville's price for putting on the other rear tire.
12046	Alan-Grissom-flat	Alan Grissom
12048	base-Client-compound	Service and Client base not ok.
12049	base-client-compound	I have stayed in this hotel many times, and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck, its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local, not so pleasant hood.
12050	found-out-compound,hours-night-compound,payers-tax-compound,money-payers-compound,dispatch-police-compound	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself, but when I had to listen to a (non-violent) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours, my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel, or just get over it.
12051	policy-hotel-compound,push-over-compound,not-to-fixed	I chose the later, but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities, not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get.
12054	slice-grandma-compound,dried-out-compound	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker.
12059	because-of-fixed	I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn't so well-done (actually, burnt).
12060	bureau-business-compound,relations-customer-compound	I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $25.
12064	line-waiting-compound,lot-parking-compound	The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot.
12066	parks-amusement-compound	I mean, that's the way it works at amusement parks: the longest lines are at the best rides.
12068	service-costumer-compound	The staff taking your order and "waiting" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all.
12069	service-customer-compound	I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks.
12071	putting-up-compound	If you have gotten through ordering, dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules, you are finally presented with what you came for..some tacos that are "ok," but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle.
12073	go-up-compound,Mac-Taco-compound	I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac.

12093	baldness-pattern-compound,due-to-fixed,passed-on-compound	The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that's a common misconception (http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm).
12097	St-21st-compound	If you want miracles you'll have to go to 21st St.

12128	prices-dealership-compound	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership, but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn't seem cost effective anymore.

12133	pick-up-compound	The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places, plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car.
12136	grew-up-compound,repair-auto-compound,shops-repair-compound,working-hard-compound	I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here, but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around.
12138	handbag-designer-compound,accessories-fashion-compound,market-niche-compound	Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company, thus we are certainly a niche market.

12142	Engine-Search-compound,Optimization-Engine-compound,strategies-Optimization-compound	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies, but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing.

12145	site-web-compound,increase-fold-compound	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months, and have 100 people following our site on Facebook, and our web site, www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic, which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional.
12147	because-of-fixed	Finally, it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with, because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator.
12149	residence-Tampa-compound	I had Hom-Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago.

12156	screen-replacement-compound,screen-replacement-compound	I called Home-Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window, and was happily surprised when they said that they weren't even going to charge me for the replacement screen...that it would be covered under their guarentee.

12172	staff-hotel-compound	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down.
12174	Guy-Sales-compound	Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
12177	guy-sales-compound	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks.
12178	guy-sales-compound	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it, but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal.
12179	salesman-car-compound	Essentially, I told him I didn't trust him cause he was a car salesman, but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back.
12188	called-in-compound	I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up, they got my order confused with someone elses.

12199	Panda-Lucky-compound	Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal.
12200	Delight-China-compound	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote.
12202	repair-auto-compound,shop-repair-compound	One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a auto repair shop.
12203	conditioning-air-compound	We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning.

12205	less-than-fixed,went-out-compound	We took it back in to have it repaired again, and less than a week later the second compressor went out.
12206	picked-up-compound	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again, but this time when we picked up the car, the radio and clock did not work.
12211	supplier-parts-compound	It was the fault of the parts supplier, and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car.

12232	put-up-compound	There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment!!!!!
12234	membership-month-compound	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away.
12235	signed-up-compound	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional.
12236	working-out-compound	Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun.
12237	room-locker-compound	The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there.
12238	rooms-locker-compound	They need to update the locker rooms ASAP.
12240	shut-up-compound	The owner was VERY rude, accused me of not reading my contract, and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership.
12241	person-staff-compound	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $50 fee (which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner.
12242	member-staff-compound	I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club's actual OWNER?!

12253	stylist-celebrity-compound	I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick.
12256	color-root-compound,brown-mousey-compound	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown.
12259	as-to-fixed	Derrick did a terrible job, was a complete jerk the entire time, and I had no warning as to the price.
12263	experience-salon-compound	It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell.
12271	Rod-Jacobsen-flat	Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA, so I did not know what to expect.
12275	figure-out-compound	Asked why, Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment (it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary, one would think) and that took time to figure out.
12278	$-6,000-compound	However, now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $6,000+ despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do, I feel I have to voice my opinion.
12279	structure-payment-compound,liability-tax-compound	Last year, after all was said and done, I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no/little tax liability at the end of the year.
12281	bill-tax-compound,$-6,000-compound	Well, again, I am now faced with a tax bill of $6,000+, all due on April 15, 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is 'well, you won't have to pay a penalty.'
12284	times-delivery-compound	Bit sketchy, sporadic delivery times

12301	dates-delivery-compound	He kept saying different arrival/delivery dates and didn't seem terribly apologetic.
12306	Service-Delivery-compound	My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger.

12312	suite-bedroom-compound,floor-showroom-compound	I spent $2300 on the bedroom suite, which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor.
12313	pushed-in-compound	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged: a piece of wood was broke on the headboard; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall; and a nighstand was missing a drawer.
12315	Furnishings-Home-compound,Mart-Furniture-compound,Service-Delivery-compound	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings, Boyles, the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned.
12316	service-customer-compound,Service-Delivery-compound,let-alone-fixed,set-up-compound	The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture.
12317	suite-bedroom-compound	So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite.
12318	suites-bedroom-compound	I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone's warehouse.
12319	service-customer-compound,sit-up-compound	Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service.
12320	School-Driving-compound	Excellent Driving School
12321	accident-car-compound	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I've been a nervous wreck and haven't been behind the wheel.
12322	emergency-family-compound	Unfortunately, a family emergency required me to conquer this fear.
12323	School-Driving-compound	A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry.
12325	package-hour-compound	I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package.

12338	Restaurant-Chinese-compound	Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
12339	San-Antonio-flat	My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food.
12342	San-Antonio-flat	Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to--and trust me we have been to a lot of them.
12343	County-Bexar-compound,Office-Tax-compound,Road-Bandera-compound	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road.
12344	out-take-compound	We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back.

12356	workers-co-compound	PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends" and I will tell you that I don't know these people except from eating at their restaurant.
12361	Dr.-Strzalka-flat,CVTS-Flagship-compound	Dr. Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
12362	Dr.-Christopher-flat	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there, but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word, and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING!!
12363	due-to-fixed	He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis.
12364	date-surgery-compound	I had a surgery date of July 17, 2008.
12365	Care-Health-compound,Proxy-Care-compound	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy, even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery (as he had twice stated i must agree to).
12369	Care-Health-compound,Proxy-Care-compound	A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed.
12371	room-hospital-compound	Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room.
12375	surgeon-heart-compound	Even my PA i went to the other day said "it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you".
12379	Home-Second-compound	I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the 'bad experience' review.
12383	introductions-dog-compound	But I've done hundreds of dog introductions myself (another place, I don't work here), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs.
12385	according-to-fixed	It sounds (according to your own statement) that they had a roomful of dogs, so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems.
12388	Home-Second-compound,Home-Second-compound,times-couple-compound	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home, to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times, getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later.
12390	at-least-fixed	My dogs are far from perfect, and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself (at least initially).
12394	hotel-Warwick-compound,Square-Rittenhouse-compound	So I say: I'm at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square (built in 1926) do you deliver to the Warwick?

12396	York-New-compound	I laugh and say, no, that Warwick is in New York, but I'm at the Radison-Warwick.
12398	CITY-CENTER-compound,PHILLY-CITY-compound	and I said, YES, CENTER CITY PHILLY, and he says, NO, Warwick is a township, If you're at a Radison in Warwick thats too far, try dominos in Pottstown.

12425	due-to-fixed	I just called again and was told that workmanship, not wood, is guaranteed for a year- well in my opinion- the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship!
12427	hold-up-compound	Well- when you pay over $1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good!!!
12430	all-of-fixed,come-by-compound	I'm very frustrated at this point- it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked (the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer.
12436	innkeeper-phantom-compound,price-minute-compound	Lots of rules, phantom innkeeper, last minute price was worth it.
12437	loop-recording-compound,gave-up-compound	I called the "207" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up.
12438	rates-minute-compound	I then called the 800 number (which was answered) and inquired about last minute rates.
12441	confirmation-email-compound	The email confirmation (which I read in the car) warned about large suitcases, declaring that we are innkeepers, not longshoreman.

12465	heads-shower-compound	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads, but only one worked.

12472	partners-dining-compound	The truth is, in my and my dining partners' experience, this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food.
12475	salads-salatim-compound	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I've ever seen placed in front of me (you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't explained to you).
12478	order-person-compound	Then again, for the three of us who dined together, two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more, and licking the hummus from our fingers (and yes, those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three-person order).
12481	glob-%-compound	The duck was a 65% glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy, crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments.
12484	semifreddo-chocolate-compound	Oh, yes, the chocolate semifreddo was quite good.
12485	cake-chocolate-compound,temperature-room-compound	The warm chocolate cake was very tasty, but served at room temperature, not warm by any stretch of the imagination.
12489	sizes-portion-compound,desserts-chocolate-compound	But one should not go here expecting something fantastic, unless perhaps you've never had middle-eastern food before, or succulent duck, tasty lamb, decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts.
12492	experience-dining-compound	Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all, and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience?

12497	number-style-compound	So, as I was leaving I asked for the designer/dress name or style number associated with my top picks.
12499	name-dress-compound,number-style-compound	Hmmm... A person cannot call a company, if you have no idea its name (since the designer is unknown... SUPPOSEDLY), and order a gown without a dress name or style number.
12501	designs-dress-compound	They either: a) don't want to give it to me because they don't want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b) are recreating the dresses themselves (ie STEALING other designers' dress designs and "filling the orders" by their own seamstresses).
12505	ladies-sales-compound,trying-on-compound	Aside from that little *mystery*, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on.

12514	Gallery-Wedding-compound,let-alone-fixed	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life.

12518	part-store-compound	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop (that is apparently what you are supposed to do, but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage, so you don't see them drving up, and they purposely block the front pull-up that all other Sear's use).
12520	pick-up-compound	Once I returned to pick up my car, you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting.
12521	card-credit-compound,card-check-compound	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn't possible.

12528	papers-service-compound	He said it was the same tire, and verified this, after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week.

12535	lock-wheel-compound	A few minutes after I left, I was called and informed that "I" left my wheel lock (which they should have left in the car).

12537	Of-course-fixed	Of course I couldn't make it back in time (and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me).
12538	lock-wheel-compound	The next day, no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in.
12539	Of-course-fixed,numbers-phone-compound,lock-wheel-compound	Of course, they couldn't call him either to ask about it because apparently they don't keep their employees' phone numbers (riiight), so I would have to return on Monday (driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat).
12545	President-Bush-flat,area-Washington-compound	President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area.

12558	troops-US-compound	The US troops fired into the hostile crowd, killing 4.
12559	officials-Baath-compound,at-least-fixed,standing-US-compound	It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong, or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis.
12560	day-analyst-compound	Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company's story to the (miniscule number of) people who haven't heard it.

12562	Street-Wall-compound	They work on Wall Street, after all, so when they hear a company who's stated goals include "Don't be evil," they imagine a company who's eventually history will be "Don't be profitable."
12563	Sergey-Brin-flat,strategy-research-compound,projects-research-compound	It's not quite as freewheeling an environment as you'd imagine: Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical 'proof' that the company's self-driven research strategy, which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own, is a good, respectable idea .

12589	engine-search-compound,support-roots-compound	What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it's always been -- a great search engine with some real grass-roots support, successful by the grace of simplicity.
12591	companies-camera-compound	The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight-for-fewest-features between low-end camera companies.
12593	branching-out-compound	It's tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus.
12594	users-Google-compound	As the survey cited in the above-linked article shows, most Google users don't intend to use Gmail, and Google isn't even as popular as Yahoo! and AOL.
12595	base-customer-compound,engine-search-compound	If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky-high valuation, Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep-it-simple search engine.

12649	of-course-fixed	To pander to the mythical "Arab street", of course.
12653	citizens-U.S.-compound	This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U.S. citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah-provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon.

12738	taking-on-compound,development-Firefox-compound,development-firefox-compound,team-development-compound	I'm inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non-Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development, they're ensuring the continued life of the project, and ensuring (not that I think they need to) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team.

12756	Monthly-Washington-compound	The Washington Monthly's Who's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double-dealing of many in the CPA.

12764	as-well-fixed,predominance-Neocon-compound,Department-Defense-compound	So I may as well just come out with it: It is pretty suspicious, given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada:

14649	such-as-fixed	In a communique, the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "raiding forces" in the assault on a city, the population of which is Muslim (such as Fallujah) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins.
14650	forces-occupation-compound	The Sunni AMS told Iraqis, "You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf, and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah.
14652	movement-Sadr-compound,as-well-fixed	The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah, as well.
14655	movement-Sadr-compound,assault-US-compound,attack-US-compound,Army-Mahdi-compound,militiamen-Army-compound	The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before, last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf.
14657	President-Bush-flat	President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words:
14659	President-Bush-flat,blow-up-compound	U.S. Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a "war with Islamic fascists," saying the term could inflame anti-Muslim tensions.
14660	officials-U.S.-compound,blow-up-compound,Qaeda-al-compound	U.S. officials have said the plot, thwarted by Britain, to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda.
14661	Nihad-Awad-flat,group-advocacy-compound	"We believe this is an ill-advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism," said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations advocacy group.

14695	Saad-Khalid-flat,Avenue-Eclipse-compound	Saad Khalid, 19, of Eclipse Avenue, Mississauga.
14696	Vikash-Chand-flat	We've got a Steven, the one word that didn't crash my spell-check, despite it being followed by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur.
14698	travel-airline-compound	But because we don't want to sound hateful we must pretend everyone's a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it's ever been.
14699	site-internet-compound,War-Holy-compound,Osama-bin-flat	On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War (al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad) , the group allegedly declared, "We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group, its prince and soldiers, have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden."
14701	Abu-Musab-flat,days-resistance-compound	Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al-Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days.
14702	Moutasaddiq-trial-flat,War-Holy-compound	One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al-Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century.
14703	groups-guerrilla-compound	If the statement is true, it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "picked up" by al-Qaeda.
14706	Usamah-Bin-flat	Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "Afghan Arabs" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden.
14707	Brigade-55th-compound,regime-Taliban-compound	It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5,000-strong "55th Brigade" of the Taliban regime, though this is not the technical definition.
14708	form-extremist-compound,million-15-compound	Because Usamah is Saudi, my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia's some 15 million citizens.
14709	group-Islami-compound,Ayman-al-flat,Egypt-Upper-compound	In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al-Jihad al-Islami group of Ayman al-Zawahiri (many of these were from Upper Egypt, especially Asyut and environs).
14710	Arabs-polyglot-compound,Bin-Laden-flat	After that point, al-Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden, only some of whom were Saudi.
14711	War-Holy-compound	Zarqawi is a Jordanian, and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian, Palestinian and Syrian.
14713	Muhammad-Prophet-compound	They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought, which has a Protestant-like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad.
14714	Pietists-Protestant-compound	(Most Salafis are not militant or violent, though they tend to be rather narrow-minded in my experience, on the order of Protestant Pietists).
14715	War-Holy-compound,Peasant-German-compound,Rebellion-Peasant-compound	Monotheism and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism, rather as the the leaders of the so-called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did.
14716	presence-US-compound,War-Holy-compound	Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War, and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia.
14717	Street-Haifa-compound	These have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra.
14718	members-Qaeda-compound	So now there are hundreds of al-Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before.
14719	group-Fizazi-compound,Combatant-Islamic-compound,Group-Combatant-compound,Muhammad-Atta-flat,bombings-train-compound	The consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with al-Qaeda can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in Tangiers that morphed into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta, and ultimately was in part responsible for the Madrid train bombings.
14721	Bin-Laden-flat	It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden's plot.
14724	words-weasel-compound	This statement is, despite its facade of fair-mindedness, so many weasel words.
14725	Of-course-fixed	Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming.
14729	fields-oil-compound,companies-US-compound	Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there, already in January or February of 2001.
14730	czar-counter-terrorism-compound,Richard-czar-compound,Richard-Clarke-flat,threat-Qaeda-compound,Laurie-Mylroie-flat,theory-conspiracy-compound,Trade-World-compound,Towers-Trade-compound,bombing-Towers-compound	Wolfowitz contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al-Qaeda threat, insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq, and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing.
14731	theories-crackpot-compound,instead-of-fixed,operation-Qaeda-compound,carried-out-compound,component-terrorist-compound,Bin-Laden-flat	If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality--that was an al-Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al-Gamaa al-Islamiyyah, an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden-- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat.
14733	chance-%-compound	Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50% chance that Iraq was behind them.
14736	bases-Qaeda-compound	Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, saying there were "no good targets" in Afghanistan.
14737	bases-Qaeda-compound,States-United-compound	(What about 40 al-Qaeda bases that had trained the 9/11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States??)
14738	according-to-fixed,Bob-Woodward-flat	The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al-Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf, according to Bob Woodward.
14741	Ahab-Captain-compound	They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam's great white whale.
14742	government-US-compound,Bin-Laden-flat	Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed.
14744	Dick-Clarke-flat,experts-Qaeda-compound	Bush demoted Dick Clarke, among the most vocal and focused of the al-Qaeda experts, from his cabinet.
14745	officers-cabinet-compound,stations-battle-compound,George-Tenet-flat,picking-up-compound,terrorists-Islamist-compound	Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers, who outranked him, and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet's hair was "on fire" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists.
14746	As-for-fixed,Clinton-administration-flat	As for the Clinton administration, let me say one thing in its defense.
14747	worked-out-compound,Minister-Prime-compound,Minister-Nawaz-flat,team-Ops-compound,Bin-Laden-flat	Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar, based from Pakistan.
14748	base-Pakistan-compound,operations-rescue-compound,in-case-fixed	I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong.
14749	space-air-compound	You also need Pakistani air space.
14751	Gen.-Pervez-flat,Nawaz-Sharif-flat	But in fall of 1999, Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif.
14753	space-air-compound,Bin-Laden-flat	Musharraf told Clinton he couldn't use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden.
14754	figure-out-compound,pull-off-compound	Look at a map and you try to figure out how, in fall of 1999, you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities.
14755	Of-course-fixed	Of course, you could just go in by main force.
14756	look-up-compound,operation-Tabas-compound	But for those of you tempted in that direction, please look up Carter's Tabas operation.
